You and Me! CAST TIME: none STATIC COOLDOWN: 10 / 5 / 0 (based on level) TARGET RANGE: 700 SPEED: 1200 / 1300 / 1400 / 1500 / 1600 Passive: While Yuumi is attached , she is untargetable (except by turrets and inbound projectiles ) and casts her abilities from the Anchor's position, empowering them with additional effects. The Anchor gains bonus attack damage or ability power based on which was already higher. The percentage bonus will benefit from the flat bonus. Bonus Attack Damage: 7. 2 / 8. 4 / 9. 6 / 10. 8 / 12 (+ 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10% of Anchor's bonus AD) Ability Power: 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 (+ 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10% of Anchor's AP) Yuumi then gains flat adaptive force plus an amount based on a portion of the Anchor's current bonus attack damage or ability power , whichever is higher. Adaptive Force: 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 Adaptive Force per 100 bonus AD: 10 / 11. 67 / 13. 33 / 15 / 16. 67 Adaptive Force per 100 AP: 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 Active: Yuumi channels for 0. 25 seconds, then dashes to the target allied champion and attaches to them upon arrival. The cooldown starts upon completing the channel . You and Me! can be recast after 0. 5 seconds. Recast: Yuumi detaches from her Anchor and dashes to the target allied champion to attach to them, refreshing the recast. She will detach automatically if her Anchor dies or under certain circumstances * . If recast without a valid target, Yuumi will detach and dash 250-units in the target direction, placing You and Me! on a 0. 25 -second cooldown if it is not already on cooldown. The dash will be knocked down by any immobilizing or polymorphing crowd control. You and Me! is placed on a 5-second cooldown if Yuumi becomes immobilized , grounded , or polymorphed . Yuumi starts with a skill point in You and Me! and Prowling Projectile instead has 6 ranks. Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit / Direction Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted Yuumi will track the target if they change locations. She will not stop tracking the target until she reaches them, as there is no maximum tracking distance. The 0. 5 -second cooldown will be incurred whenever Yuumi attaches to an Anchor , whether by the active or the recast. If the target moves 2000 or more units away during the dash, it will be interrupted and You and Me! will be placed on full cooldown. The ability name for the recast is Change of Plan . You and Me! does not count as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and stacking Force Pulse . Kassadin also cannot gain stacks for Force Pulse from Yuumi casting spells while she is untargetable . Yuumi can channel the Eye of the Herald while attached. The ability power multiplier is additive with other ability power multipliers, like from Rabadon's Deathcap or Infernal Might . The bonus attack damage multiplier is additive with other sources of bonus attack damage multipliers, like from Unseen Predator and is multiplicative with total attack damage multipliers, like from Whisper or Infernal Might . Yuumi will automatically detach in the following circumstances: When her Anchor starts a Teleport channel. After the Anchor completes a Recall channel. When she or her Anchor enters resurrection . Her Anchor is sent to the Realm of Death . She is pulled by Fate's Call . Yuumi can dash to targetable zombie state allies (currently only Sion's Glory in Death ), but she cannot attach when she reaches them. The same goes for allies channeling Teleport . While attached to the Anchor , Yuumi is considered in being at her Anchor's position, regardless of where she is visually placed near them. For example, turret shots will appear as if they were hitting the Anchor , but in reality they're actually hitting Yuumi . However, for the purposes of You and Me! , such as casting it or being unattached for other reasons, Yuumi will be in the position where she visually is. For example, when she is in the blue team, dashing to a north-east ally is considerably slower than dashing to a south-west ally. Her monster aggression transfers to the Anchor . Enemies gain an assist on Yuumi if they damaged the Anchor . Yuumi will always be visible if her Anchor can be seen, and she will always not be visible if her Anchor cannot be seen. These rules apply regardless of reveal effects and stealth . Yuumi will not vanish if her Anchor does. If Yuumi is on the blue team, she will remain attached on the southwest side; if Yuumi is on the red team, she will remain on the northeast. While channeling Final Chapter , she will be behind her Anchor . Yuumi doesn't detach instantly when her Anchor dies. There's a small grace period in which she can recast You and Me! to attach to another champion without the channel . The player's screen will briefly flash red if Yuumi is affected by a immobilizing or grounding effect, or if she forcibly detaches from her Anchor . The Anchor's health bar will have a different frame to indicate the attached status: The following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is channeling : Type Channel Attacking Disabled Abilities Disabled Movement Disabled Items Usable Shurelya's Battlesong Youmuu's Ghostblade Randuin's Omen Disabled All the other item-actives are disabled Interrupted by N/A Consumables Usable Spells Usable Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Disabled Teleport Recall Hexflash Interrupted by Flash Interrupted by Death Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects The following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is attached : Attacking Disabled Abilities Allowed Movement Disabled Items Usable All the other item-actives are usable Disabled Hextech Rocketbelt Stridebreaker Interrupted by N/A Consumables Usable Spells Usable Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Disabled Flash Teleport Recall Hexflash Interrupted by N/A Interrupted by Death Zoomies Zoomies COST: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 (+ 12% maximum mana) Mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 11. 5 / 11 / 10. 5 / 10 CAST TIME: none Active: Yuumi heals herself and gains 20% bonus movement speed and bonus attack speed for 3 seconds.

Final Chapter Final Chapter COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 110 / 100 / 90 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 1100 WIDTH: 450 SPEED: 3000 Active: Yuumi and Book channel for 3. 5 seconds to barrage 7 waves in the target direction that each deal magic damage to enemies hit. Enemy champions hit take 50% damage from subsequent waves, and when they are struck by three waves, they become rooted for 1. 25 seconds. This may occur only once per target. Magic Damage Per Wave: 60 / 80 / 100 (+ 20% AP) Reduced Damage Per Wave: 30 / 40 / 50 (+ 10% AP) Maximum Champion Damage: 240 / 320 / 400 (+ 80% AP) Maximum Non-Champion Damage: 420 / 560 / 700 (+ 140% AP) Yuumi can move during Final Chapter . Link ▶️ "THIS IS MY FAVORITE CHAPTER!!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Yuumi becomes ghosted for the channel and, if not presently attached with You and Me! , will remain ghosted until she attaches and detaches again. (bug) While attached , Cloud Dragon Soul will not activate until Yuumi detaches. Spell shield will only block a single instance of damage. Enemies hit by three waves of Final Chapter have a marker placed upon them for 6 seconds. This marker prevents the target from becoming rooted again until its duration ends. Yuumi's facing direction during the channel is considered to be in Final Chapter's target direction. Using Hexflash during the channel will always cause Yuumi to blink in the target direction of Final Chapter .
