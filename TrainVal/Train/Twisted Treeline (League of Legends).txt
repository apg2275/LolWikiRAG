Twisted Treeline Map “ "Deep in Shadow Isles lies a ruined city shattered by magical disaster. Those who venture inside the ruins and wander through the Twisted Treeline seldom return, but those who do, tell tales of horrific creatures and the vengeful dead." — Twisted Treeline in-game descriptiopn (Pre-client update) Twisted Treeline was the second classic gameplay map for League of Legends . It typically features faster, bloodier matches with an emphasis on ganking and small-scale skirmishes. You achieve victory by pushing your way into the opposing base and destroying the enemy nexus . A smaller map than Summoner's Rift , the Twisted Treeline is configured horizontally, with two lanes flanking a neutral area. Turrets are placed along the length of each lane, and the nexus is defended by a single turret. Teams are composed of three champions apiece, and each champion spawns with a substantial sum of gold. The reduced map size and accelerated level curve makes for a shorter game length and higher kill scores. The Twisted Treeline was retired from the game on November 19th, 2019 for the end of Season Nine .

This article or section may contain obsolete information, but exists here for historical purposes. Twisted Treeline Minimap The objective of Twisted Treeline is simple: destroy the enemy nexus. In order to do this, champions must traverse down one of two different paths (or lanes ) in order to attack their enemy at their weakest points they can exploit. Both teams have their lanes defended by numerous turrets ; each turret grows in strength the closer it gets to its respective nexus and each turret must be eliminated in order to gain access to the next turret in that lane. Cooperating with fellow summoners is an absolute requirement for success, as it is easy for a champion to find themselves ambushed by enemies in the lanes of the map. The basic strategy consists of having one player in each lane, and a jungle in between. Work with your teammates to use the close lanes as a chance to kill enemy champions as a team. The next level of strategy is to funnel both jungle and top wave resources into a single attack speed scaling champion. Because of the "middle" lane, champions with the ability to hop the wall or roam effectively are very powerful. The jungle is easier to clear than in Summoner's Rift . The jungle is good to sneak on the opponent and also to outsmart them by running away or baiting them into a bad position. AD carries are viable, but they must be protected by their team like on Summoner's Rift . The roles of champions are more or less the same as in 5v5 matches, but a setup with an AD carry should have enough cc to make him/her safe. The lair of Vilemaw is a high-value objective. Be aware of the location of enemy champions to know when they are attacking Vilemaw . The shop does not have wards, so vigilance is the only means of protecting Vilemaw from the other team. Although wards do not exist in the shop, some champions like Caitlyn , Heimerdinger , Jhin , Maokai , Nidalee , Shaco , Teemo , and Zyra have abilities that can be effectively used as wards. Features [ ] Map features [ ] Two bases, one for each team, at both sides of the battlefield. The bases have a fountain/shop, a nexus, and one turret that defends the nexus. You can buy items and regenerate health and mana while in the fountain/shop. Three turrets per lane that defends the access to the bases. Two altars located on both sides of the jungle. A Ghost Relic , which is a health pick-up located in the center of the battlefield. It replenishes health and a small amount of your ability resource. It also grants a brief speed boost. A jungle populated by neutral monsters of varying degrees of toughness. The epic monster Vilemaw , whose camp is located to the top of the top lane. Champions [ ] Starts the game with 850 . Gain 0. 67 % bonus mana regeneration for every 1% missing mana . Important Timers [ ] Minions spawn: 0:45 Jungle monsters spawn: 1:05 Minions meet: 1:07 Ghost Relic spawn: 2:30 Altars unlock: 2:30 Vilemaw spawns: 10:00 Surrender time: 15:00 Altars [ ] Twisted Treeline Altar Main article: Altar The altars are neutral objectives that can be captured by either team. There are two altars on opposite sides of the map. A champion captures an altar by standing on top of it for 9 seconds. When more champions stand on a single altar, it is captured in a shorter amount of time. When captured, an altar seals for 90 seconds during which it grants vision of the surrounding area and during which cannot be recaptured. Capturing an altar grants 80 to each member of the capturing team. Additionally, controlling an altar grants your team bonus effects. One Altar Controlled: 10% bonus movement speed. Two Altars Controlled: Restore 1% of maximum health on minion and monster kill. Items [ ] Most items available in the shop, are the same as in Summoner's Rift or Howling Abyss . Some items are exclusive to Twisted Treeline . It is also good to note that there are no wards or ward items available. The only vision item you have is the default trinket: Arcane Sweeper . Exclusive Items Arcane Sweeper Lord Van Damm's Pillager Moonflair Spellblade Wooglet's Witchcap (replaces Rabadon's Deathcap and Zhonya's Hourglass ) Wooglet's Witchcrown (with Ornn on your team) Timeworn Ancient Coin / Timeworn Nomad's Medallion / Timeworn Talisman of Ascension Timeworn Relic Shield / Timeworn Targon's Brace / Timeworn Face of the Mountain Timeworn Spellthief's Edge / Timeworn Frostfang / Timeworn Frost Queen's Claim Map-Specific Changes [ ] Twisted Treeline had some map-specific balancing: Garen's Courage Bonus resistances on-kill changed to 0. 5 . Number of enemy kills needed to reach the maximum amount changed to 60. Gangplank's Parrrley New Effect: Passively gains 1 Silver Serpent per second. Rengar's Bonetooth Necklace New Effect: After gaining 3 Bonetooth Necklace stacks, the per-target lockout resets, but the maximum amount of stack (without The Hunt is On! ) is still 5. Shyvana's Fury of the Dragonborn Alternate Innate: Shyvana deals 20% bonus physical and magic damage to Vilemaw . Additionally, Shyvana starts with 5 bonus armor and 5 bonus magic resistance , which is permanently increased by 5 for every Vilemaw her team slays. Skarner's Crystal Spires Number of Crystal Spires placed on the battlefield changed to five: One within Vilemaw's pit (which is neutral) One nearby each Golem One nearby each Giant Wolf In the Domination tree, Ravenous Hunter , Ingenious Hunter , Relentless Hunter , and Ultimate Hunter used to grant stacks relative to the number of takedowns and each unique altar capture. The user was not required to participate in seizing the altar in order to receive a stack. Zombie Ward and Ghost Poro were replaced by Eyeball Collection due to the lack of wards . Waterwalking was replaced by Scorch due to the absence of a river . Jungle [ ] Twisted Treeline Jungle Twisted Treeline's single, centralized, jungle offers multiple access routes to both lanes, promoting fast ganks and aggressive counter-jungling. Junglers on Twisted Treeline typically engage enemy players early and often, coming to the aid of either lane or leading the attack on the opponent's altar. Expect plenty of action in neutral areas on this Field of Justice. Neutral Monsters Main article: Monster Vilemaw The jungle has three monster camps on each side. A monster camp respawns 75 seconds after all the monsters in the camp die. Each side has the same camps: Golem camp : Big Golem and one Golem . Wraith camp : Wraith and two Lesser Wraiths . Wolf camp : Giant Wolf and two Lesser Wolves . The only monster in the upper jungle is Vilemaw . It spawns ten minutes into the game and respawns six minutes after dying. When a team defeats Vilemaw it receives the Crest of Crushing Wrath buff on all living team members, which provides several bonuses for a few minutes. Minions [ ] Minion spawning location On Twisted Treeline minions did not grant the same amount of gold on kill and some had different stats: Melee minions granted 20 (+ 0. 125 / 90s). Caster minions granted 17 (+ 0. 125 / 90s). Siege minions : Granted 45 (+ 0. 35 / 90s). Had a base health of 828. Had a health growth of 23 / 32 (based on wave) .

Trivia [ ] General Map Game modes Development Twisted Treeline houses the life essence of two spirits that were once mortals before the Ruination. The Twisted Treeline's remake is heavily influenced by Elise's concept and development. Twisted Treeline Shopkeeper After capturing one of the two altars on Twisted Treeline, champions originating from the Shadow Isles , which include Hecarim , Mordekaiser , Elise , Karthus , and Yorick , the summoned 'spirit' will say unique messages to those particular champions. The messages are different for west and east altars , representing good and evil respectively. This, however, excludes Evelynn , because Riot didn't want to give too much information about her lore, and Thresh , because lines for him have not been recorded yet. In addition, all Shadow Isles champions can also hear additional lines available to all of them, including Evelynn and Thresh. All the messages can be seen here or on the altar page. Ebonmaw's skeletal remains can be seen scattered around Vilemaw's lair. If two champions dance in front of Vilemaw within 5 seconds, he will join in by doing the Carlton. [3] The old map had a unique interaction with Cassiopeia : while present in the game, the snakes that were part of the maps idle animations were hidden/disabled. Twisted Treeline map has been used for certain special, limited-time, featured game modes that circulate in and out. During the Fall of 2014, for the Harrowing event, Riot introduced the game mode called Hexakill mode on this map. [4] The mechanics were similar to Classic mode, with the only difference being that On each team instead of 3 players, there were 6 players Icons were to be given by playing this mode. During the end of May and the beginning of June 2015, Hexakill mode was featured again on this map. This time players could ban 6 champions in a match through the Blind draft pick. Twisted Treeline only has one kind of shopkeeper on both sides of the maps. Its appearance resembles that of a headless horseman adorning a pumpkin for a head. The Twisted Treelines was released shortly before the game officially launched. October 27, 2009: Released publicly in custom games [5] March 30, 2010: Released for normal games [6] The Twisted Treeline map was reworked, and the new version released with patch V1.0.0.150 on October 17, 2012. [7] It was previously located near Zaun but was retroactively relocated to the Shadow Isles . Interview about the map [ ] Marc 'Tryndamere' Merrill in an interview with Zam.com first mention the map: [8] So in regards to the new map, which is one of the hottest items that we're really excited about, we're about to roll one out. It's going to be going into the beta shortly. I don't know if it's in this release or if it's in the release at the end of the month. It's coming out really soon, it's a two-lane map, it's awesome, there's a lot of action, it's really well designed to force action to the middle of the map, and it's designed for a 3 on 3 play experience. So it's a very different experience, it will be a lot of fun for users to go bang away on that. The map was first shown to the public on October 19, 2009, on the games' Facebook page. [9] A Thanks to All Twisted Treeline Players [ ] BY SHIO SHOUJO<ref name="retire"> As announced earlier this year, Twisted Treeline will officially be retired at the end of this season.

Players who achieved ranks through Twisted Treeline games will still get those end of season rewards when the season officially ends on November 19 12:00AM PT.
