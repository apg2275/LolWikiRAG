For all associated collection items, see Amumu (Collection) . Original View in 3D 260 25.06.2009 Legend claims that Amumu is a lonely and melancholy soul from ancient Shurima, roaming the world in search of a friend. Doomed by an ancient curse to remain alone forever, his touch is death, his affection ruin. Those who claim to have seen him describe a living cadaver, small in stature and wrapped in creeping bandages. Amumu has inspired myths, songs, and folklore told and retold for generations—such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction. Cristina Milizia Unknown artist Loot eligible Pharaoh View in 3D 520 02.02.2010 Boy-king of the southern wastes, Amumu's mummified body still haunts the halls of his ancient tomb.

Cristina Milizia Unknown artist Pharaoh Loot eligible Legacy Vancouver View in 3D 520 12.02.2010 The Vancouver Board of Public Safety would like to assure citizens that no cursed mummies have been spotted within the city limits.

Cristina Milizia Unknown artist Goth Loot eligible Re-Gifted View in 3D 520 14.12.2010 Like decorative soaps or a fifth pair of socks, Amumu has been passed back and forth between disgruntled family members for generations.

He's been lonely in ages past, but no more: Lux is like his big sister, and Kindred is his… Kindred? Companionship hasn't stopped his occasional tantrums, of course, but at least now there's someone to shine his porcelain eyes after a nice cathartic cry.

Love, Your Secret Friend-mirer 'Til the End Cristina Milizia Ina Wong, West Studio Heartthrobs and Heartaches Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Heartache Amumu Chromas Amethyst Catseye Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Amumu's original icon for Bandage Toss shows him in a pose that references Spider-Man 's web shooting from Marvel Comics . Amumu is seen on a caution sign in the game's Mac Version trailer. Amumu was the third champion to attain 7 skins . Amumu's dance references the Goth kids' dance in South Park . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Both are in turn parodying classic ' Peanut's Dance ', a bizarre shuffling dance performed by the characters from the Peanuts comic and animated films. When Amumu dies, his pose is that of an Egyptian mummy with his arms crossed right over left. This is a nod to him being a Shuriman boy prince in life. Amumu's price range was lowered from 1350 to 450 in accordance with the release of his The Curse of the Sad Mummy music video. Amumu and Blitzcrank were planned to have Sewn Chaos skins, but both were cancelled for failing to meet Riot 's quality standards. They may return in the future. The ward skin Sad Mummy Ward references him. He has a base size of 50 which is considered medium.
