V5.9 Gameplay Update Stats Basic attack projectile speed increased to 2500 from 2000. Attack speed growth reduced to 3. 333 % from 4%. Frost Shots - Repurposed Ability New Innate: Ashe's basic attacks and abilities apply Frost to enemies damaged, slowing them by 5 − 35 (based on level) % for 2 seconds. Ashe's basic attacks against frosted units always critically strike, dealing 「 10 + (X * (1 + Y))% AD bonus critical damage, where X is her critical strike chance and Y is her bonus critical strike damage (both in decimal format) 」 「 10% AD bonus critical damage, plus an additional 1% AD for every 1% of her critical strike chance that is modified by 1% for every 1% of her bonus critical strike damage 」 . Ashe cannot otherwise critically strike. Notes: Frosted targets are distinct from Slowed targets - only Ashe's Frost Shot can trigger the bonus damage. Other slows don't trigger it. Ashe's empowered attacks ( even the base 10% AD with no crit chance ) are classified as critical strikes for gameplay purposes and will trigger effects such as Frenzy and Reinforced Armor . [1] As such, it is also not applied by Runaan's Hurricane . Here are examples on the behaviour of Frost Shot's bonus damage. [2] None of the following considers the 100% AD base damage from basic attacks. Infinity Edge will deal 40% AD bonus damage ( 10 + ( 20 ×  (1 + 0. 5 ) ). Adding a Phantom Dancer increases the aforementioned to 92. 5 % AD bonus damage ( 10 + ( 55 ×  (1 + 0. 5 )). With 100% critical strike chance and Infinity Edge's bonus critical damage, you will deal 160% AD bonus damage ( 10 + ( 100 ×  (1 + 0. 5 ) ). Probable Bug: Critical strike damage from runes is stacking multiplicatively with Infinity Edge, rather than additively, for a maximum of 228. 265 % bonus damage (10 + 100 × 1. 5 × 1. 4551 ). Ranger's Focus - New Ability Passive: Ashe gains a stack of Focus for 4 seconds whenever she slows an enemy, stacking up to 5 times. Ashe will not generate stacks while Ranger's Focus is on cooldown. Active: Ashe consumes all Focus stacks to gain 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% bonus attack speed and increases Frost Shot's slow strength 「 by 20% 」 「 to 25 − 55 (based on level) % 」 for 4 seconds. If Ashe consumes 5 stacks of Focus on activation, Ranger's Focus will also cause each of Ashe's attacks to fire a flurry of five arrows, dealing 「 23 / 24 / 25 / 26 / 27% modified attack damage with each arrow 」 「 a total of 115 / 120 / 125 / 130 / 135% attack damage on each empowered attack 」 . The flurry will stack multiplicatively with Frost Shots , will benefit from life steal and triggers on-attack effects five times, but on-hit effects are only applied once. Cost: 50 mana Cooldown: 18 seconds Notes: The multi-attack effect is similar to Lightslinger and Double Strike , except that on-hit effects aren't applied by the extra attacks. Triggering On Attack Effects multiple times is intentional. [3] - namely, Runaan's Hurricane and Pix . Note that Pix's cannot attack more than twice per second. On-hit effects are disabled on the latter four attacks and will not be triggered even by Runaan's minor bolts. As such, the item's 10 on-hit damage is only applied by the first attack. Runaan's splash damage is affected by the damage modifier - dealing 「 10 (+57. 5 / 60 / 62. 5 / 65 / 67. 5 AD) damage per flurry 」 「 11. 5 / 12 / 12. 5 / 13 / 13. 5 % AD damage per arrow (+ 10 on the first) 」 to secondary targets. As with Headshot , attacks against structures will refresh the timer on Focus but will not generate new stacks. The multi-attack effect will work on structures - i.e. you will plink towers faster than Jinx . Volley Arrows increased to 9 from 7. Radius is unaffected. Mana cost reduced to 50 mana from 60. Cooldown reduced to 12 / 10 / 8 / 6 / 4 seconds from 16 / 13 / 10 / 7 / 4. New Effect: Targets can now intercept multiple arrows, but will take no damage from arrows beyond the first. Arrows beyond the first will still generate Focus. Hawkshot Passive gold generation removed. Range increased to Global from 2500 / 3250 / 4000 / 4750 / 5500. New Effect: Now works with a stock system, able to hold up to two charges. Static cooldown implemented at 5 seconds. Recharge time increased to 90 / 80 / 70 / 60 / 50 versus the current 60 / 55 / 50 / 45 / 40 cooldown. Enchanted Crystal Arrow No longer innately slows, but will apply Frost Shots' slow. Slow percentage effectively reduced to 5 − 35 (based on level) (+20% during Ranger's Focus)% from 50%. Slow duration effectively reduced to 2 from 3. Release version [ ] V4.17 General Texture update to Classic, Amethyst, Freljord, Queen, Sherwood Forest, and Woad Ashe. V4.5 Stats Base armor increased to 15. 5 from 11. 5 . V4.2 New ability icons.

V3.8 Focus Ashe now gains 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 Focus stacks every second while not attacking instead of gaining critical strike chance.
