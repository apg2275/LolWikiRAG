An enemy can be affected by Event Horizon only once every 4. 5 seconds. Units that negate the stun will still count as passing through the edges.

At the start of the cast time, all enemy champions in a 390-radius become marked for Veigar to gain an assist on them should they perish within the standard 10 seconds assist time. Event Horizon may fail to catch enemies that move very quickly through the boundary distance. More modern area checks such as Thresh's The Box or Caitlyn's Yordle Snap Trap do not have this issue.

Original View in 3D 585 23.07.2009 An enthusiastic master of dark sorcery, Veigar has embraced powers that few mortals dare approach. As a free-spirited inhabitant of Bandle City, he longed to push beyond the limitations of yordle magic, and turned instead to arcane texts that had been hidden away for thousands of years. Now a stubborn creature with an endless fascination for the mysteries of the universe, Veigar is often underestimated by others—but even though he believes himself truly evil, he possesses an inner morality that leads some to question his deeper motivations. Bob Beal Sixmorevodka Studio Loot eligible White Mage View in 3D 390 17.12.2009 A master of healing magic residing within an ancient cathedral, Veigar self-identifies as a dastardly archvillain rather than the pious cleric he clearly is. His magic has cured ailments and dispelled curses from across the land, much to his chagrin. Bob Beal Unknown artist Medieval Loot eligible Curling View in 3D 520 12.02.2010 Curling is a sport where players slide stones across the ice with a stick. Veigar is an evil yordle obsessed with annihilating the great cities of Valoran. It just makes sense. Bob Beal Unknown artist Winter Sports Loot eligible Legacy Veigar Greybeard View in 3D 750 08.09.2010 A suspiciously helpful wizard the party meets early in their adventure, Veigar Greybeard holds a dastardly secret—he's the true villain of Riftquest! Of course, this is obvious to anyone who played the starter campaign, but you still shouldn't spoil it for newcomers. Bob Beal Unknown artist Rift Quest Loot eligible Leprechaun View in 3D 520 15.03.2011 Contrary to popular belief, Veigar won't grant three wishes, isn't a fairy, and doesn't hide gold coins at the end of a rainbow. He will, however, kill you. Which is none of the things you want out of a magic leprechaun. Bob Beal Unknown artist Fables Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Baron Von View in 3D 975 27.06.2011 Ruler of the New Bandle Republic, Veigar considers himself the ultimate dark power of the wasteland—an evil so great that no man, woman, or creature would ever dare challenge his authority. Recently, he fixed up a water purifier and an electric grid for the city, too. An electric grid… OF EVIL! Bob Beal Unknown artist Road Warrior Loot eligible Legacy Superb Villain View in 3D 975 02.01.2012 The villainous Veigar is at it again! Reigning from the top floor of the Veigar Company skyscraper, the criminal mastermind hatches the vilest plans New Valoran has ever seen! Yet even when his schemes are foiled, he always escapes punishment, biding his time until his next chance to strike! Bob Beal Unknown artist Silver Age Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Bad Santa View in 3D 975 14.12.2012 Most Santas wish to bring joy and enchantment to children everywhere, but Veigar wants no such thing. His dark ambitions have grown beyond simply thwarting Snowdown—he schemes to throw the world into chaos, blotting out the holidays with his evil forever. Bob Beal Volta Studio Snowdown Showdown Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Final Boss View in 3D 1820 27.08.2014 Once merely a mini-boss with a Napoleon complex, Veigar has ripped into the code of Arcade World to summon hundreds of other bosses to his side. Together they'll stop at nothing to reach his ultimate goal: take the world for himself, and give the heroes a final Game Over.

He thinks of it as “a fun quirk.” Bob Beal Jojo So Omega Squad Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Omega Squad Veigar Chromas Catseye Sapphire Tanzanite Elderwood View in 3D 1350 29.08.2019 A small number of the Elderwood's children remain largely unaffected by the growing influence of the Coven, to the relief of scholars and storytellers alike. Unfortunately, those particular children are some of the most whimsical and dangerous, including among their number the insane goblin Veigar and his cursed, hallucinogenic toadstools.
