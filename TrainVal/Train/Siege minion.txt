One siege minion spawns every three minion waves between the melee and caster minions . Notes [ ] Siege minions upgrade every 90 seconds increasing their health, gold reward and AD. At the sixth upgrade they change their health scaling. Other than their gold reward, their stats increase infinitely. There are a total of 10 gold upgrades, first upgrade starts at 3:35 (From 60 to 63) and lastly at 16:05 (87 to 90). Take note that the gold increase only effects the siege minions spawned, and doesn't increase siege minions who are still on the map. After 15 minutes (15:05), siege minions spawn once every 2 waves and from the 25th minute onward (25:05), siege minions spawn every wave to accelerate the game pace by making pushing easier. Summoner's Rift Siege minions spawned into the mid lane wave gain 30% bonus attack speed while attacking turrets (not including other structures). The bonus attack speed is granted on-hit when hitting a turret and removed on-hit when hitting any other type of unit. While under the effect of Hand of Baron , siege minions can out-range turrets.
