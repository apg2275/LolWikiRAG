Updated Summoner's Rift Map (Pre-Elements Update) The Maps or Fields of Justice are areas where players play champions and battle against one another in order to achieve victory. While there are different maps for each game mode, some maps have different skin variants based on seasonal or story events. The most widely used map for seasonal events is Summoner's Rift , which also features touches from the professional play season, such as tournament assets, the Summoner's Cup , or the one and only annual World Champion . Maps [ ] Main Maps See also: Arena (Teamfight Tactics) Summoner's Rift (11) : The oldest and most venerated Field of Justice is known as the Summoner's Rift. This battleground is known for the constant conflicts fought between two opposing groups of Summoners. Traverse down one of three different paths in order to attack your enemy at their weakest point. Work with your allies to siege the enemy base and destroy their Nexus! There are three lanes in Summoner's Rift, namely the top lane, mid lane, and bottom lane, while a jungle spreads inbetween them. Champions are assigned to start in each area. Each lane has three turrets in line, and there are two more guarding the Nexus . The jungle contains various unique monsters that hold powerful buffs for a team to acquire; the Rift Scuttler is the only non-hostile monster while epic monsters such as the Baron and Dragon are formidable "bosses" that may be highly contested. Howling Abyss (12): - The Howling Abyss is a bottomless crevasse located in the coldest, cruelest, part of the Freljord. Legends say that, long ago, a great battle took place here on the narrow bridge spanning the chasm. No one remembers who fought here, or why, but it is said that if you listen carefully to the wind you can still hear the cries of the vanquished tossed howling into the Abyss. There is only one lane guarded by two lane turrets and two Nexus turrets per team. You cannot Recall or heal in base, but there are heal altars near the turrets . Summoning Platform Arena All competitors start in the Shop Platform , which is split into four equal areas. Four teams of two players are assigned to each. When the Shop Phase is over, the teams will be teleported to one of four randomly chosen fighting arenas through a huge portal which can be seen in front of the platform. At the middle there is the Shop, kept by a bubbly pink creature, a choncc . The main event takes place in the Rings Of Wrath : Ancestral Woods is inspired by the mystical Ionia . Old but lively cherry trees envelop the map, while a lively fountain of Deep Water can be seen in the middle. Ancestral Woods Desert Oasis is inspired by the desert of Shurima . It has an earthen theme, with monoliths scattered along the edges, while many long Deep Water pits heavily divide the map. Desert Oasis Frostbite Thicket is inspired by the snowy Freljord . It has a glacial tundra theme with a lot of coniferous trees, and it is divided by bulky and tall mountainous walls. Frozen water stands at the edge of the map while an aurora looms over from the corner. Frostbite Thicket Magma Chamber is inspired by the original Magma Chamber . Its terrain is made of magic-infused stones, and it features a distinctive large drop-shaped Deep Water pit at the center. Vast areas of brush extend throughout the ring. Magma Chamber ‏‏‎ All the Rings Of Wrath arenas can randomly feature NPC champions that are called "cameos". These champions will appear oversized and compete against the fighters, contributing damage or crowd control . See Arena for more information. Discontinued / Event Maps "You belong in a museum!"
