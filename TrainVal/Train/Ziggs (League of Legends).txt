The bomb explodes upon landing near an enemy, within terrain, or the final bounce, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies. Magic Damage: 85 / 135 / 185 / 235 / 285 (+ 65% AP) Bouncing Bomb will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

Spell shield will block the damage of the explosion, but the explosion can still damage other targets in the radius. Ziggs will throw the bomb from his location at the end of the cast time, towards the pre-clamped cast location, causing the bounces to adjust their angle accordingly. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 125 / 175 / 225 / 275 / 325. AP ratio changed to 75% AP .

Satchel Charge can be recast within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards. If recast while in flight, the charge will explode immediately upon landing. Recast: Ziggs detonates the charge, causing it to explode to deal magic damage to nearby enemies and knock them back up to 500 units away from the center of the explosion, though not through terrain. If this hits Ziggs , he will dash up to 825 units away from the center. Magic Damage: 70 / 105 / 140 / 175 / 210 (+ 50% AP) Turret Explosion: The explosion also executes enemy turrets within that are below a maximum health threshold.

Detonating the ability manually does not. Deals area damage to non-turrets and raw damage to turrets. Satchel Charge's distance increases with proximity to the charge, resulting in being knocked straight up when aligned directly on top of it. Ziggs will not dash from Satchel Charge's detonation while Teleporting but he will while Recalling .

Edit Hexplosive Minefield Hexplosive Minefield COST: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 mana COOLDOWN: 16 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 900 EFFECT RADIUS: 325 / 135 SPEED: 1550 Active: Ziggs scatters a cluster of 11 proximity mines over the target location that grant sight of the area for 2 seconds, arming after 0. 5 seconds and lasting for up to 10 seconds. Each mine within the area explodes upon contact with terrain or an enemy, dealing magic damage and slowing them for 1. 5 seconds, as well as granting sight of the area around the explosion for 2 seconds. An enemy takes 40% damage from subsequent mines. Magic Damage per Mine: 30 / 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 (+ 30% AP) Reduced Damage per Mine: 12 / 28 / 44 / 60 / 76 (+ 12% AP) Maximum Total Magic Damage: 150 / 350 / 550 / 750 / 950 (+ 150% AP) Slow: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50% Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked The mine cluster is built of 2 rings, with 3 mines in the inner ring (radius pending for test) and 8 mines on the other ring (200 radius), all equally spaced. The angular offset is randomized on each cast. Because of the 135 detonation radius of each mine, the total possible range of a mine from the minefield hitting an enemy from the cast location is 335 units. It will often be slightly less as the minefield is not guaranteed to be angled the right way for this. Mines will not explode upon contact with player-generated terrain . Spell shield will block the effects of a single detonation. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Now affected by +30 ability haste. AP ratio changed to 40% AP .

The bomb explodes upon arrival to deal magic damage to enemies hit, increased by 50% against those in the epicenter. Magic Damage: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 73. 3 3 % AP) Increased Damage: 300 / 450 / 600 (+ 110% AP) Link ▶️ "I bring the Big One!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Allies cannot see Mega Inferno Bomb's area indicator until shortly before the blast. Mega Inferno Bomb takes 2. 64 seconds from the start of the cast time to land when Ziggs casts at maximum range (reduced to 1. 617 seconds from the start of the cast time when casting within 2700 units). When cast within 2700 units, Mega Inferno Bomb has a fixed travel time. Beyond that, the travel time is equal to the cast distance divided by the now-fixed missile speed. The area reveal on the target location begins as soon as the cast time is completed and can see into brush and across terrain.

Original View in 3D 880 01.02.2012 With a love of big bombs and short fuses, the yordle Ziggs is an explosive force of nature. As an inventor’s assistant in Piltover, he was bored by his predictable life and befriended a mad, blue-haired bomber named Jinx. After a wild night on the town, Ziggs took her advice and moved to Zaun, where he now explores his fascinations more freely, terrorizing the chem-barons and regular citizens alike in his never ending quest to blow stuff up.

He keeps insisting he's a 'waterologist,' which isn't a real thing. Alessandro Juliani Kienan 'Knockwurst' Lafferty Pool Party Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Snow Day View in 3D 975 14.12.2012 Ziggs knows a thing or two about lobbing bombs, and he's happy to take a break and throw snowballs around instead. If by “a couple”, you mean several hundred, and by “balls”, you mean volatile spheres of explosive wintery death. Alessandro Juliani James Strehle Snow Day Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Master Arcanist View in 3D 1350 06.05.2015 Ziggs dwells at the crossroads of science and magic, striking an eccentric figure whose collection of enchanted artifacts and forbidden tomes rivals the greatest in the known world. He uses this arcane knowledge to make bombs. Magic bombs. Big ones.

All can agree that no matter the consequences, Ziggs seems to enjoy his experiments—especially the subsequent explosions. What is perhaps most miraculous of all is how he and Tocker have survived so many blasts over the years.

Ziggs is one of the few champions that can apply crowd control on themselves (the others being Caitlyn , Lissandra , Rumble , Sion , Varus , Vi and Xerath ). Ziggs' dance references 'Midget Superstar'. A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Ziggs was a nickname for Rioter Joe 'Hephastopheles' Ziegler . Heimerdinger reveals that Ziggs's full name is Zigmund , from Proto-Germanic *segiz "victory" & *mundō " protection "; [2] the latter element is shared with Dr. Mundo . Ziggs and Nautilus were first conceived as ' Ivan the Mad Bomber'. Hexplosive Minefield was conceived as Ziggs' ultimate (was later replaced by Mega Inferno Bomb ) Mega Inferno Bomb's icon references a nuclear weapon . Ziggs seems to be the mascot for featured game modes . This is evident from his likeness being used on numerous summoner icons that represent or commemorate them, as well as having his teaser picture be the base for the promotional art for a lot of these game modes . A prop of Ziggs' Hexplosive Bomb was crafted in an episode of YouTube series DIY Prop Shop . This video can be viewed here . There are also videos where the following are crafted: Diana's Crescent Moonblade ( functional ) Katarina's Daggers ( functional ) Leona's Zenith Blade ( functional ) Master Yi's 'Highlander' Ring Sword ( functional ) Poppy's Hammer of Orlon ( functional ) Yasuo's 'Last Breath' Sword ( functional ) The icon for Satchel Charge is reused for the Teamfight Tactics item Demolitionist's Charge .
