Magic Damage: 40 / 75 / 110 / 145 / 180 (+ 4% (+ 3% per 100 AP) of target's current health) Capped Monster Damage: 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 / 175 Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Elise_QVideo.ogv Edit Volatile Spiderling Volatile Spiderling COST: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 CAST TIME: 0. 125 TARGET RANGE: 950 COLLISION RADIUS: 150 EFFECT RADIUS: 275 Active: Elise summons a venom-gorged spider for 3 seconds, which is untargetable and crawls to the target location, navigating its path upon encountering terrain. The spider explodes upon contact with an enemy or at the end of its lifespan, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies. Magic Damage: 60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 (+ 95% AP) If the spider does not hit an enemy before reaching the target location, it chases down a nearby enemy, prioritizing champions and gaining bonus movement speed based on its proximity to the target. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked If Volatile Spiderling dashes to a target due to Venomous Bite , it will not expire before finishing its jump. It can still collide with enemies while dashing, but since this proximity check is repeated only every so often, it might phase through an enemy on its way without detecting the collision if dashing quickly enough. The spiderling checks for nearby targets every 0. 264 seconds , both for potential enemies to chase down and to explode 'on-contact'. Because of this, it may walk closer to an enemy than its "collision radius" before exploding.

Stun Duration: 1. 6 / 1. 8 / 2 / 2. 2 / 2. 4 Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Cocoon deals no damage and thus does not trigger turret aggro, or effects such as Elixir of Sorcery and Sudden Impact's activation.

The damage based on the target's health ratio is capped against monsters . Magic Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 8% (+ 3% per 100 AP) of target's missing health) Capped Monster Damage: 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 / 175 If there are active Spiderlings or Volatile Spiderlings nearby, they will dash alongside Elise towards Venomous Bite's target and reprioritize them. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Grounded Blocked See Notes Disabled Knockdown Interrupted Venomous Bite cannot be used to cross walls or impassable terrain. The target will be damaged regardless. Spiderlings can cross walls and terrain to reach Venomous Bite's target and will attack provided Elise stays within their leash range . There is a maximum range in which Spiderlings or Volatile Spiderlings can dash to the target. Spiderlings will dash even if they are crowd controlled . Venomous Bite will always apply its effects after the cast time, even if the dash is interrupted. Elise will not dash if the target is within basic attack range. Venomous Bite will still deal its damage but not apply on-hit effects if it is blocked or dodged . It cannot be missed while Elise is blinded . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Spiderling Bonus Attack Speed: 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25% Active: Elise and her Spiderlings gain bonus attack speed for 3 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100% Skittering Frenzy resets Elise's basic attack timer. Elise loses Skittering Frenzy immediately when she switches to Human Form . Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Auto No additional details. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Elise_WVideo.ogv Edit Rappel Rappel COOLDOWN : 22 / 21 / 20 / 19 / 18 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 700 Active: Elise and her Spiderlings lift up into the air, vanishing and becoming unable to act for up to 2 seconds and granting sight of the area for the duration. Rappel can be recast on a target enemy within the duration, and does so automatically after the duration without a target. Recast: Elise and her Spiderlings instantly descend behind the target, or their current position if there is no target. If cast directly on an enemy, Elise and her Spiderlings automatically recast on the target after 1 second. Upon landing this way, Spider Queen's bonuses are increased for 5 seconds. Spider Effects Increase: 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100% Rappel's recast can be used while affected by cast-inhibiting crowd control . Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location / Unit Counters Grounded Disabled When Elise casts Rappel , a circle outlines the area in which a target can be selected to descend upon. She cannot descend outside the bounds of this circle. Elise will descend behind her target with Rappel's recast. If the target is at the edge of the circle, she will descend as close as possible to the target. The buff granted from casting directly on an enemy is not lost if Elise switches to Human Form . Rappel can be cast on any targetable enemy unit ( champions , minions , monsters , wards , traps , and jungle plants ) except structures . Elise will attempt to position behind her target if she descends closer than Rappel's max range. Without additional vision, Elise cannot Rappel to Rift Herald from the other side of the Baron Nashor's pit, but can Rappel to Dragon by standing near the Scryer's Bloom spawn locations. This is a result of sight being granted in a smaller circle than the target range limit for descending and the Summoner's Rift map having height variations. With sight of the target, both can be accessible with Rappel from behind the pits. Elise has a smaller range for ground-targeting . Elise will walk into range and then perform Rappel if this ability is cast while targeting a location outside of this range. If Elise enters resurrection during Rappel , she will descend back down immediately. The following table refers for interactions while Elise is in Rappel : Attacking Descends onto the attack target.

Toggle: Elise switches between her Human Form and Spider Form . Spider Form: Elise transforms into a spider, gaining 25 bonus movement speed , melee basic attacks with 125 range , and access to her arachnid abilities. Additionally, she summons all stored Spiderlings . Human Form: Elise transforms into a human, gaining ranged basic attacks, and access to her human abilities. Additionally, she stores all active Spiderlings . Elise begins with one rank in Spider Form / Human Form and can increase it at levels 6, 11, and 16. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Auto Transformations do not count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. If Spider Form is cast during a basic attack windup , Elise will perform a Spider Form basic attack that benefits from the bonus damage and healing from Spider Queen , but remain at Human Form basic attack range, despite not using a projectile. This basic attack is considered a melee attack and thus will not trigger Runaan's Hurricane 's Wind's Fury bolts. Spider Form and Human Form have separate cooldowns.

Original View in 3D 880 26.10.2012 Elise is a deadly predator who dwells in a shuttered, lightless palace, deep within the oldest city of Noxus. Once mortal, she was the mistress of a powerful house, but the bite of a vile demigod transformed her into something beautiful, yet utterly inhuman—a spider-like creature, drawing unsuspecting prey into her web. To maintain her eternal youth, Elise now prefers to feed upon the naive and the faithless, and there are few who can resist her seductions. Sydney Rainin-Smith Katie 'TeaTime' De Sousa Loot eligible Death Blossom View in 3D 975 26.10.2012 An enchanting beauty she is, lithe in form, and colored like the flowering valleys frozen mid-bloom by winter's chill. Yet the creature Elise dines upon the flesh of maidens, allured by her delicate pulchritude, who dance softly into the jaws of a monster.

Rumor has it she's been blacklisted for spinning webs of lies, forming and disbanding allegiances in the span of a single evening. Attendees have also noted her suitors never seem to make a return visit to the festival.

Reborn in the image of an arachnoid deity, Elise lingers along the edges of the Elderwood, enticing to their doom all those foolish enough to believe her a mere folktale.
