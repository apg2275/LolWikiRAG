Viego can basic attack a Mist Wraith to consume it: causing him to blink to its location after winding up for 1 second, during which he is untargetable (except to turrets ) and unable to act . He then gains Possession and heals himself for 2% (+ 2. 5 % per 100 bonus AD) (+ 2% per 100 AP) (+ 5% per 100% bonus attack speed) of the target's maximum health . Possession: For 10 seconds, Viego assumes the enemy champion's form and gains their basic attacks , basic abilities , items , and base stats (based on Viego's level ). He also gains a free cast of Heartbreaker , which is initially placed on a 1. 5 -second cooldown, and 10% bonus movement speed while facing enemy champions within 2500 units. Viego cannot use item actives , consumable items , nor the shop during Possession . Casting Heartbreaker or attacking a Mist Wraith ends Possession immediately. Viego will preserve his current health percentage between transformations. Link ▶️ "You will serve!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Counters Grounded Not Disabled Viego will copy the possessed champion's ability ranks. Viego cannot level up their abilities with his available skill points. Mist Wraiths will expire when Viego dies, and they will not expire while he is winding up on them. Viego gains the bonus movement speed during possession even while moving towards nearby enemy champions that are untargetable . Finishing the possessing attack against a Mist Wraith kills it, rewarding Viego an extra 3 as he becomes the target champion. The wind up's untargetability does not destroy in-flight projectiles from turrets . The possessed champion's abilities do not cost any mana or energy even if that specific champion normally uses either as a casting resource . Alternative resources , such as Fury , Flow , or Health , will still be utilized. The current cooldowns of Viego's abilities will not be reset between transformations. Those of the possessed champion's abilities will be reset between transformations. This does not apply to the following long-cooldown abilities. Viego specifically tracks their proper cooldowns which can be seen via a buff in his hotbar for each when applicable. Anivia's Rebirth Azir's Shurima's Legacy Corki's "Special Delivery" Package Zac's Cell Division The passive cooldowns of items are shared between Viego's and the possessed champion's. This does not apply to Lifeline items. (bug) Once possession ends, Viego returns to his normal state and certain effects gained from the possessed champion's abilities will be immediately removed. Some buffs will be kept and some buffs will be lost. Viego will almost always keep shields and spell shields . Passive effects will be lost by default, as Viego no longer has their abilities. Channeled abilities maintained will be interrupted. Toggled abilities will be automatically toggled off. Viego retains his own summoner spells , trinket item , and runes during possession . Mist Wraiths will still spawn while Viego is in a zombie state. Sovereign's Domination will not summon a Mist Wraith from clones . The possession will not expire while Viego is in a zombie state . While in a zombie state, Heartbreaker is disabled. If Viego enters a zombie state while winding up on a Mist Wraith , the possession will still last its normal duration. (bug) The possession will not end prematurely if Viego enters resurrection . The possession will acquire the basic abilities of shapeshifting champions (e.g. Elise's Spider Form / Human Form , Jayce's Transform Mercury Cannon / Transform Mercury Hammer , and Nidalee's Aspect of the Cougar ) based on which form they died as. Mist Wraiths are considered clones and can only be targeted by Viego . If Viego possesses an enemy champion who owns Dark Seal or Mejai's Soulstealer , he will gain their Glory stacks for the possession. As Cull tracks its progress for each player even if they do not possess the item at the time, Viego may discharge stacks for the benefit of 1 each per minion kill, and if Viego killed 100 minions possessing Cull , no matter whether bought himself or acquired via a possessed champion's inventory, he receives the 350 payout and can no longer discharge stacks. This entire interaction does not interact with the state of the Cull stacks of the enemy. The stacks shown on the item in the inventory and scoreboard may not update properly, however. If Viego possesses an enemy champion who owns Tear of the Goddess , the stacks it has will be transferred to his Tear of the Goddess if he owns one. If Viego possesses an enemy Bel'Veth , his attack speed cap will be modified to 90 permanently. (bug) If Viego possesses an enemy K/DA Evelynn , he will still hear Demon Shade's music upon discarding the possession if he does it while active. (bug) If Viego targets a Mist Wraith while already untargetable he will become targetable once again during the cast time. (bug) If Viego possesses an enemy on Howling Abyss , he will be able to use the shop upon returning to the fountain and discarding the possession. (bug) The following table refers for interactions while Viego is winding up on a Mist Wraith : Attacking Disabled Abilities Disabled Movement Disabled Items Usable N/A Disabled All items are disabled Interrupted by N/A Consumables Disabled Spells Usable Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Disabled Flash Teleport Recall Hexflash Interrupted by N/A Interrupted by Death Edit Blade of the Ruined King Blade of the Ruined King COOLDOWN: 5 / 4. 5 / 4 / 3. 5 / 3 CAST TIME: 0. 35 (at base attack speed) RANGE: -25 - 600 WIDTH: 125 Passive: Viego's basic attacks are empowered to deal bonus physical damage on-hit , which has a minimum threshold and is capped at 80 against monsters . This damage is affected by critical strike modifiers. Bonus Physical Damage: 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6% of target's current health Minimum Bonus Damage: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 Additionally, his damaging abilities apply a mark to enemies hit for 4 seconds. Viego's next basic attack against a marked target is empowered to consume the mark on-hit to strike a second time, dealing 20% AD (+ 15% AP) physical damage and healing him for 135% of the post-mitigation damage dealt, increased to 145% against monsters and reduced to 10% against minions . The second strike applies on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness and can critically strike for 35% (+ 7%) AD (+ 26.25% (+ 5.25%) AP) physical damage if the triggering attack does. Active: Viego stabs in a line in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit, increased by 0% − 100% (based on critical strike chance) , and 20 bonus physical damage against monsters. Physical Damage: 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 (+ 70% AD) × (1 + (100% + 0% ) critical strike chance) Monster Damage: 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 (+ 70% AD) × (1 + (100% + 0% ) critical strike chance) Blade of the Ruined King's passive remains under Possession , and while transformed, the second strike is instead converted to bonus damage on-hit which no longer applies on-hit effects but can still critically strike (based on possessed stats). Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Blocked See Notes Not Blocked The mark will not be applied to the primary target struck by Heartbreaker , but it can triggered from it. Blade of the Ruined King's cast time is always 140% of the caster's attack windup time. At base attack speed, Viego's attack windup is 0. 25 seconds. An easy formula to calculate the cast time is [ 0. 23 seconds divided by total attack speed ]. Reducing Viego's attack speed via attack speed reductions also increases Blade of the Ruined King's cast time by the same fraction. It is calculated from Viego's total attack speed after cap (2.5) and floor (0.2), making the maximum possible cast time 1. 155 seconds . Blade of the Ruined King's cast time becomes the same as the standard 0. 264 seconds cast time for most abilities at 32. 6 % bonus attack speed . Applies area damage for the thrust and proc damage for the bonus damage on-hit and second strike. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Viego will not perform the second strike if the first attack was dodged , blocked , and missed . If the second strike hits a dead unit, Viego will still heal based on the post-mitigation damage that he would deal with it. The attacks do not deal the bonus damage against structures . Edit Spectral Maw Spectral Maw COOLDOWN : 8 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 300 / 500 − 900 (based on channel time) WIDTH: 120 SPEED: 1000 / 1300 Active: Viego charges while being slowed by 10% for up to 3 seconds to increase Spectral Maw's missile range and stun duration over the first second of the channel. Spectral Maw can be recast within the duration. If the charge completes without reactivation, Spectral Maw is cancelled and placed on full cooldown . If the charge is interrupted , it will be placed on a 3-second cooldown. Recast: Viego hurls a blast of mist in the target direction and dashes a fixed distance in the same direction, though not through terrain. The mist deals magic damage to the first enemy hit and stuns them for 0. 25 − 1. 25 (based on channel time) seconds. Magic Damage: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 100% AP) Spectral Maw resets Viego's basic attack timer. Viego can cast any of his abilities during the dash. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto / Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded Blocked Blocked Disabled Knockdown Disruption Interrupted Interrupted The reduced cooldown from the charge will not occur if Spectral Maw's cooldown is already below 3 seconds.

If it hits terrain , the mist will spread further around either side. While inside the mist, Viego gains bonus attack speed . If he does not attack or cast abilities, he also gains bonus movement speed and camouflage . Bonus Attack Speed: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Bonus Movement Speed: 25 / 27. 5 / 30 / 32. 5 / 35% (+ 4% per 100 AP) Declaring a basic attack or casting an ability will break the camouflage and remove the bonus movement speed , preventing Viego from gaining them again for 1 second, reduced to 0. 6 seconds if he recasted Spectral Maw and increased to 2 seconds if he attacked a monster . This duration refreshes on subsequent attacks and ability casts. Harrowed Path can be cast during any of Viego's abilities. He cannot gain the camouflage nor bonus movement speed from Harrowed Path for 0. 75 seconds after starting the channel of Spectral Maw , recasting ends this duration prematurely. Hide Details Tips & Tricks Info Targeting input Direction Counters Projectile Not Blocked The bonus movement speed and camouflage are granted by the same buff. Viego will enter camouflage even while Recalling . Viego can cast Harrowed Path during the cast time of any ability or spell. Ranking up Harrowed Path while the effect is already active will still immediately improve the bonuses it grants. Harrowed Path can interact with player-generated terrain . Viego can benefit from an enemy's Harrowed Path . PENDING FOR TEST: : Enemy's Harrowed Path grant Viego his ability's bonus or the enemy's.

Edit Heartbreaker Heartbreaker COOLDOWN: 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 5 TARGET RANGE: 500 EFFECT RADIUS: 300 Active: Viego gains displacement immunity over the cast time, then blinks to the target location. Upon arrival, he strikes the most wounded enemy champion nearby , dealing physical damage , slowing them by 99% for 0. 25 seconds, and applying on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness. Other nearby enemies are knocked back up to 400-units away based on proximity, though not through terrain. Physical Damage: 12 / 16 / 20% (+ 5% per 100 bonus AD) of target's missing health All targets hit are dealt 120% − 240% (based on critical strike chance) AD physical damage . If a Possession is discarded, Heartbreaker will be placed on a 1. 5 -second cooldown if it is not already on cooldown. Heartbreaker will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Link ▶️ "Isolde!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro See Notes Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Grounded Blocked See Notes Disabled Heartbreaker will cast at the edge of its range if the target location is further beyond. Heartbreaker will cast at maximum range from the end of Spectral Maw's dash if it is cast during the dash. The knockback speed is 1000 units per second. The airborne is removed as soon as the displacement ends. The maximum airborne duration is therefore 0. 4 seconds. The minimum is 0. 1 seconds. Applies spell damage to the struck champion and area damage to all other enemies. Viego will enter a 0. 25 -second cast time if he strikes an enemy champion. Heartbreaker's strike to the champion can be dodged and blocked , but not missed . Viego will be ordered to basic attack the primary target afterwards.

Original View in 3D 975 21.01.2021 Once ruler of a long-lost kingdom, Viego perished over a thousand years ago when his attempt to bring his wife back from the dead triggered the magical catastrophe known as the Ruination. Transformed into a powerful, unliving wraith tortured by an obsessive longing for his centuries-dead queen, Viego now stands as the Ruined King, controlling the deadly Harrowings as he scours Runeterra for anything that might one day restore her, and destroying all in his path as the Black Mist pours endlessly from his cruel, broken heart.

His champion theme features a segment of the song Blade of the Ruined King by Pentakill . Viego is possibly inspired by the Spanish word viejo (lit. "old") and the name Diego , as his kingdom appears to be inspired by Spain and Camelot . [2] There are also the Spanish surname Viego [3] and parish Viego in northern Spain. Isolde (~ Iseult ) referrences Iseult of Ireland from the chivalric romance Tristan and Iseult The first three new champions following Viego's release ( Gwen , Akshan and Vex ) were directly tied to his return and continued his story with each release. [4] Viego's placeholder was a purple Jarvan IV during his development, due to the similarity between the length of their lance and sword.
