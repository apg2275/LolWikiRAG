Similar items Archangel's Staff Dead Man's Plate Essence Reaver Hextech GLP-800 Runic Echoes Statikk Shiv Notes Item VFX Luden's Echo will trigger on any source of damage which triggers spell effects , regardless of the type of damage . Each ability cast will generate 10 charges. Toggled and transformation abilities do not trigger on-cast effects, and thus do not grant charges. Examples include Karthus' Defile , Singed's Poison Trail , Jayce's Cannon / Hammer , Elise's Spider Form / Human Form and Nidalee's Aspect of the Cougar . Moving by any means provides 1 charge for every 35 in-game units traveled. This includes but is not limited to simple movement, using dashes or blinks , being moved while attached to another unit or being displaced to another location. Luden's Echo applies spell effects as area damage . Note that Luden's Echo does not affect the classification of the triggering ability - an ability that applies spell damage will apply spell effects from that damage classification, and not Luden's Echo's . Luden's Echo will not apply champion-specific spell effects, such as Blaze , nor duplicate the effects of a champion ability (e.g. Blinding Dart will not blind all enemies hit and Baleful Strike will not generate ability power for every enemy killed or enemy champion hit). Echo's bounce grants vision around you to the enemies. (bug) Trivia This item was designed to replace the removed Deathfire Grasp as the third high-end AP item. The name "Luden's Echo" was data-mined from the PBE update pushed on 2015-02-17. [1] The item was later enabled for testing with placeholder name "Item 3285". The name "Luden's Echo" comes from a player who reached 1000 referrals on the old Refer-A-Friend system. [2] During testing on the PBE , the item's icon was a purple recolor of Statikk Shiv .
