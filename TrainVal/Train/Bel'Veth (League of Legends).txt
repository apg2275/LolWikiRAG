Baron Nashor and pit Rift Herald spawn an Enhanced Void Coral . Active: Bel'Veth dashes to the target Void Coral to consume it over the cast time, slowing nearby enemies by 25% ramping to 99% over the duration. She then creates an explosion at the location to deal true damage to enemies within, capped at 1500 versus monsters, and assumes her True Form for 60 seconds. Bel'Veth consumes all existing Void Corals at once, generating a stack of Lavender for each one consumed. True Damage: 150 / 200 / 250 (+ 100% AP) (+ 25% of target's missing health) True Form: Bel'Veth evolves into a monster, gaining bonus health , bonus movement speed out-of-combat , 50 bonus attack range , as well as increased total attack speed .

Endless Banquet's takedown effect will not trigger against monsters if they were slain by an enemy. Endless Banquet's true damage based on the target's missing health is calculated before the base damage is dealt. True Form's duration is refreshed based on the type of Void Coral that Bel'Veth consumes. Consuming a normal Void Coral in a normal True Form state refreshes the duration to 60 seconds. Consuming an enhanced Void Coral refreshes the duration to 180 seconds and grants the enhanced effects regardless of current True Form state. If she consumes a normal Void Coral while in an enhanced True Form state, the current duration is extended by 60 seconds. The enhanced effects are not lost in this case. Bel'Veth will consume all existing Void Corals at once, therefore she is able to acquire the enhanced effects of True Form even if she does not physically consume an enhanced Void Coral . The Void Coral that Bel'Veth consumes herself will not expire in the process of her doing so. Bel'Veth will consume all other Void Corals upon consumption regardless of range. Ranking up Endless Banquet will update the bonuses dynamically; if Bel'Veth has True Form upon the level-up, she will receive the upgraded stats. Bel'Veth gains the bonus health and heal from Endless Banquet at the start of the cast time. Bel'Veth will be able to consume the target Void Coral even if her dash is interrupted. She dashes at the start of the cast time. A Void Coral will not spawn when scoring a takedown against a summoned Rift Herald .
