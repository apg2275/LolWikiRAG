The Blue Sentinel is a neutral monster on Summoner's Rift . Killing the Blue Sentinel grants the Crest of Insight , a buff which grants increased mana regeneration (or energy regeneration ) as well as ability haste . When the map transforms into the Elemental Rift , the Blue Sentinel becomes Draconic , gaining this form if alive and respawning in it each time. Killing it in this form leaves behind a buff wisp at the camp's location for 60 seconds. The wisp can be picked up by an allied champion moving near it, granting them the Crest of Insight buff. If the killer did not have Smite , the wisp can only be picked up by a champion that does so. Once the Baron Nashor spawns at 20:00 , the Blue Sentinel becomes permanently corrupted by the Void if it is not Draconic , transforming into a Voidborn with 30% increased health. Killing it in this form grants you and all your allied champions, if alive, the Crest of Insight buff. Any remaining Draconic Blue Sentinels that are slain respawn as Voidborn instead. Notes [ ] Without slows, the Blue Sentinel has a movement speed of 275. When its patience runs out its movement speed is increased by 20%, to 330. Blue Sentinel deals 5% of the target's current health bonus physical damage with its attacks. Trivia [ ] The Blue Sentinel is the evolution of the Ancient Golem , a removed monster. The old icon for Crest of Insight was recycled from Tabu's Tattoo . The Blue Sentinel will join Popstar Ahri if she dances in front of him. His dance references Open the Door by Im Chang-jung . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. He shares this dance with Daisy . From patch V5.22 to patch V7.9 , he also shared this dance with the Rift Herald . Its animations have been recycled for various game assets. These include: The Rift Herald from patch V5.22 to patch V7.9 . Daisy . The Ironback brawler from Black Market Brawlers , a featured game mode . The Terraburster and Alphacyte monsters from Odyssey: Extraction , a featured game mode. The Walking Nexus unit and Jungle Guardian from Nexus Blitz , a featured game mode. Patch History [ ] V14.2 Bug Fix: No longer respawns in its voidborn form prior to Baron Nashor's spawn after dying in its draconic form for the first time. V14.1 New Effect: Upon becoming Draconic , killing the Blue Sentinel drops a Crest of Insight wisp at the location of the camp either for the player that has Smite equipped or, if the killer is the Smite user, at most one ally to pick up. The wisp lasts for 60 seconds. New Effect: After Baron Nashor spawns, all newly-spawned or live non- Draconic Blue Sentinel monsters become permanently corrupted by the Void, transforming into voidborn with 30% increased health and granting the Crest of Insight buff to the killer and all allies alive upon slaying it. The Blue Sentinel loses its Draconic effects with the Corrupted monster's respawn. Removed: No longer always drops a Crest of Insight wisp lasting for 60 seconds at the location of the camp when a player on the team has Primal Smite equipped.
