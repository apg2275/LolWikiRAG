Similar items Shurelya's Reverie Zeke's Convergence Notes A champion using the item's active shield This item's active will not stack. More than one ally using this item will only refresh the shield on nearby allies. Strategy Works well with Gargoyle Stoneplate due to its bonus health scaling. Trivia This item was inspired by the Iron Solari Conclave, a fan-made forum group that was named after Leona and is supported by Michael 'IronStylus' Maurino . Numerous other groups, led by various Riot staff members, were also formed and "warred" with the Iron Solari, but the Iron Solari were arguably the most successful. A reworked version of this item once existed on the PBE for testing to be potentially shipped to V8.6 . The active was changed to deploy a small field on the target area that granted damage reduction to all allied champions within [1] . This was later scrapped and reverted [2] .
