Crest of Cinders Edit Description Basic attacks slow by ( 5 / 10 / 15 / 20% / 5 / 7. 5 / 10% ) (based on level) for 3 seconds, and burn the target for 2 seconds, which deals 10 − 75 (based on level) true damage over 3 instances over the duration. The first instance of damage occurs on-hit and the second and third instances occur each second thereafter. Subsequent attacks against a burning target will only refresh its duration. While out-of-combat with enemy champions and epic monsters , heal for 0. 5 / 1 / 3% (based on level) of maximum health every 5 seconds. If slain by an enemy champion and if the buff was gained from a non- Corrupted Red Brambleback , Crest of Cinders will transfer to the killer. Stats Duration 120 Source Red Brambleback Affect Holder only The Crest of Cinders , commonly known as the "red buff" or simply "red," is a neutral buff granted by the Red Brambleback , which is only found on Summoner's Rift . The buff appears visually as a spinning red rune circle on the ground around the champion who currently holds it. How to obtain [ ] By landing the killing blow to the Red Brambleback . By picking up a wisp of the buff at the Red Brambleback's camp location. This wisp is spawned when the Red Brambleback is killed in its Draconic form and lasts for 60 seconds. The monster gains this Draconic form after the map transforms into the Elemental Rift . The wisp can be picked up by one of the killer's allied champions depending on if they had Smite or not. If they did, then the wisp can be picked up by one of their allies. Otherwise, it can only be picked up by an ally that has Smite . By being alive when the Red Brambleback is slain by your allies in its Voidborn form. The monster becomes corrupted by the Void after Baron Nashor spawns at 20 minutes into the game, turning into a Voidborn that empowers the Crest of Cinders to be granted to both the killer and all their allied champions if they are alive. By killing a champion that possesses this buff; it is transferred and the duration of the buff is refreshed. This transfer only occurs if the buff was initially obtained from a non- Voidborn Red Brambleback . Notes [ ] The burn does not apply to structures . The damage-over-time debuff deals proc damage . Re-applying the damage effect the moment the target is dealt damage from it may cause the target to get dealt the damage of 2 ticks. Re-applying the damage effect and triggering Electrocute may cause the target to get dealt the damage of 3 ticks, with 1 tick dealing 40 true damage . The buff can only be lost by timing out or death . Receiving the buff while dead will keep it after respawning. Strategy [ ] The jungler will most likely take the red buff early in the game, even before any other camps. The extra damage dealt lets the jungler clear minion waves easier and take on epic monsters, like the Dragon . The slow from the buff is extremely valuable for the jungler to successfully execute a gank and is also useful for kiting monsters to reduce damage. The slow is more effective when applied by melee attacks than ranged attacks. Note, however, that it is easier for ranged champions to apply the slow without getting in dangerous situations, and they can use it to keep melee attackers at a distance by kiting them. The damage dealt is true damage . This makes it valuable in killing enemy champions who have high armor and magic resistance . Syndra's Force of Will can be used on the Red Brambleback to quickly apply the debuff to a nearby enemy champion.

Removed: If the buff was granted from a Corrupted Red Brambleback , it no longer transfers to the killer.

New Effect: After Baron Nashor spawns, all newly-spawned or live non- Draconic Red Brambleback monsters become permanently corrupted by the Void, transforming into voidborn with 30% increased health and granting the Crest of Cinders buff to the killer and all allies alive upon slaying it.
