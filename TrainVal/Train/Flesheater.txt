Recipe Flesheater 1460 ( 300 ) Vampiric Scepter 900 ( 550 ) Long Sword 350 Long Sword 350 Cost Analysis Gold Value 20 attack damage = 720 10% life steal = 550 Total Gold Value = 1270 Gold efficiency Flesheater's base stats were 86. 99 % gold efficient. Flesheater became 100% gold efficient after reaching six stacks . Strategy Collecting the needed 5 stacks from something else than minions ( wards , towers , enemy champions ) allows you to use the active more often for minions thus increasing the stacks gained per creep wave. Using the active during skirmishes can offer a significant advantage, specially with champions that scale well with attack damage or have high attack speed or both. Trivia Flesheater was the only item that grew in power without a cap. Flesheater was only available in the Black Market Brawlers featured game mode. It is also only item available that offered infinite stat growth, similar to old items Feral Flare and pre- V5.13 Devourer .
