Her title, The Enlightened One , references Gautama Buddha & Awakening . Mantra was named after the eponymous Hindu sacred utterances , from Indo-Iranic *mántram < PIE * men- [2] tro- m "instrument of thought". The 'translation' for Mantra's Ancient Ionian language was provided by Player Support Escalation Specialist 'Marowe'. Karma was the first champion to feature an ' Art Spotlight ' before release and the first to be fully relaunched . She was the fifth to have more than four abilities (the others being Elise , Gnar , Heimerdinger , Jayce , Lee Sin , and Nidalee ). Like Jayce , Karma used to have six ranks on each basic ability and only one on her ultimate . Renewal's root has the longest duration in-game (3. 25 seconds with Focused Resolve and Mantra both fully-ranked). In the minigame Astro Teemo , the most expensive upgrade in the game that Teemo's can purchase, Soul Shield, is a reference to one of Karma's pre-rework skills of the same name. Karma, the Enlightened One In Karma's most current lore, Karma's spirit has lived countless lives only to be re-incarnated within new bodies, inspired by the eponynous concept in Dharmic religions . The name of her current incarnation, Darha , comes from Sanskrit adjective दृढ dṛḍhá < दृळ्ह dṛḷhá " firm , steadfast", sharing PIE root dʰer- "to uphold" with Dar ius . [3] [4] Karma was the fourth champion to feature two ' Champion Spotlights ' due to significant gameplay changes (the others being Ezreal , Katarina , Lee Sin , and Sivir ) Inspire's speed buff reads “Vroom Vroom!”.
