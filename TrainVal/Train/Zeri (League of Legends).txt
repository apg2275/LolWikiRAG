Her basic attacks consume charge to deal modified damage. Zeri gains maximum charge when the game starts and upon respawning . Basic Attack: Zeri zaps the target, applying spell effects as spell damage , and triggering on-cast effects. This cannot critically strike nor trigger on-hit and on-attack effects. At full charge, Zeri's next attack is empowered to consume all charge to deal 90 − 200 (based on level) (+ 110% AP) (+ 1% − 15% (based on level) of target's maximum health) magic damage . The damage based on the target's health ratio is capped at 300 against monsters . While not at full charge, Zeri's attacks deal 10 − 25 (based on level) (+ 3% AP) magic damage , and execute targets below 60 − 150 (based on level) (+ 18% AP) health . Each attack consumes 10 charge if she has enough already. Link ▶️ "Electrocute!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile See Notes Bypass Not Blocked Charged attacks only deal the base damage to structures . Uncharged attacks do not execute enemies that are shielded or invulnerable while below the health threshold. Spell shield will only block a fully charged attack. Uncharged attacks are not blocked. The attack's range is not increased from attack range increases ( Rapid Firecannon , Lethal Tempo ). Instead, Burst Fire's reach is. Uncharged and charged attacks trigger Tear of the Goddess' Mana Charge . The empowered attack will trigger but not be consumed against wards . Edit Burst Fire Burst Fire COST: None STATIC COOLDOWN: 1 ÷ Zeri's attack speed RANGE: 750 + 100% bonus attack range WIDTH: 80 ANGLE: 5° / 2° SPEED: 2600 / 3400 Active: Zeri fires a burst of 7 rounds in the target direction that each deal physical damage to the first enemy hit. Total Physical Damage: 15 / 17 / 19 / 21 / 23 (+ 104 / 108 / 112 / 116 / 120% AD) Physical Damage per Hit: 2. 14 / 2. 43 / 2. 71 / 3 / 3. 29 (+ 14. 86 / 15. 43 / 16 / 16. 57 / 17. 14 % AD) Burst Fire's projectile is treated as a basic attack : it hits any enemy unit a typical basic attack can; deals basic damage ; can critically strike for (75% + 40% ) bonus damage; and applies on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectiveness to the first enemy hit. Burst Fire's cooldown and cast time are reduced with attack speed , with the maximum of 1. 5 attacks per second. 70% of attack speed in excess of the cap is converted into bonus attack damage . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Basic damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked See Notes Blocked Burst Fire is automatically learned with her first skill point upon spawning. Any of Burst Fire's rounds hitting a champion will draw minion aggro, regardless of whether or not other targets were hit first by Burst Fire's rounds. A lightning chain from a Lightning Crash empowered Burst Fire will not draw minion aggro. Burst Fire does not trigger Tear of the Goddess' Mana Charge . Burst Fire's cooldown is not reduced by Navori Quickblades' Transcendence and its damage is not amplified by Impermanence . Amumu's Tantrum's , Fizz's Nimble Fighter's , and Leona's Eclipse's flat damage reduction apply to each of the 7 instances of damage from Burst Fire . Warden's Mail's flat damage reduction and cap only apply to the first instance of damage. Guardian's Horn's flat damage reduction only applies to the first instance of damage, but handles it as damage-over-time (reduced to 25% effectiveness). Burst Fire still counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as triggering Force Pulse's passive. It does not count as an ability activation for Spellblade . Burst Fire can hit all enemy units that a basic attack would be able to target. This does include jungle plants , structures , and wards . Wards will only be hit once by Burst Fire . Stealthed wards and traps will not be hit. Champion-summoned units behave differently depending on the unit. Gangplank's Powder Keg and Yorick’s Dark Procession are hit only once by Burst Fire , and any subsequent rounds not empowered by Spark Surge will stop upon reaching the same object. Kalista’s Sentinel is hit only once by Burst Fire , but any subsequent rounds will continue to travel through the Sentinel . If Burst Fire hits an enemy while Zeri is not visible to enemies, the area around her (400 units) will be revealed for 4. 5 seconds. Burst Fire rolls critical strike for all rounds as well as the additional physical damage dealt when Zeri is Overcharged . Burst Fire is parried by dodge and block . Blind causes Burst Fire to cast in a random direction. The rounds will still deal damage to enemies hit. Burst Fire's rounds are each fired in the target direction from where Zeri is at the time. Only attack speed granted by being Overcharged can exceed the cap of 1. 5 . Hail of Blades and Lethal Tempo do not allow Zeri to exceed her attack speed cap. Items and runes that trigger off of attacking [eg Fleet Footwork , Phantom Dancer ] will only trigger if Burst Fire hits a unit. If Zeri would get full Energized stacks from a Burst Fire , the rest of the rounds will trigger Energized. Burst Fire's cast-indicator does not show range increases; modified range VFX are still visible around the champion model. Burst Fire can apply the effect of Horizon Focus when the enemy hit is within the last 50 units of this ability. (bug) Burst Fire uses a modified icon when empowered by Spark Surge ( ) and Lightning Crash ( ) as well as both ( ). Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit Zeri will start the game with one point already ranked in Burst Fire! , allowing her to allocate the other two to her other abilities. Edit Ultrashock Laser Ultrashock Laser COST: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 55 − 0. 3 (based on bonus attack speed) RANGE: 1200 / 1500 WIDTH: 80 / 200 SPEED: 2500 Active: Zeri fires an electric pulse in the target direction that deals physical damage to the first enemy hit and slows them for 2 seconds. If the pulse hits terrain , it transforms into a laser in a line that grants sight of the area for 1. 75 seconds and fires after 0. 85 seconds, applying the same effects to enemies hit and critically striking for (75% + 40% ) bonus damage against champions and monsters . Physical Damage: 30 / 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 (+ 130% AD) (+ 25% AP) Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked See Notes Applies spell damage for the pulse and area damage for the laser. The pulse missile is blocked by projectile-interception effects but not the laser. Ultrashock Laser interacts with player-generated terrain . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Edit Spark Surge Spark Surge COST: 90 / 85 / 80 / 75 / 70 Mana COOLDOWN : 22 / 21 / 20 / 19 / 18 CAST TIME: None RANGE: 300 SPEED: 600 + 100% movement speed Active: Zeri dashes in the target direction. She will dash farther across terrain if Spark Surge was cast within 50 units of any, gaining unobstructed vision of the surrounding 800 units and revealing herself while there are enemy champions within 1500 units of her. Afterwards, she gains Lightning Rounds for 5 seconds, empowering Burst Fire to deal bonus magic damage to the first enemy hit, increased by 0% − 85% (based on critical strike chance) , and pierce through enemies, though dealing modified damage after the first and not applying attack effects nor life steal to secondary targets. This damage is affected by critical strike modifiers. Burst Fire Bonus Magic Damage: 20 / 22 / 24 / 26 / 28 (+ 12% bonus AD) (+ 20% AP) Burst Fire Modified Secondary Damage: 80 / 85 / 90 / 95 / 100% Spark Surge's current cooldown is reduced by 0. 5 seconds for every champion Zeri hits with charged basic attacks or abilities, increased to 1. 5 seconds if she does so with a cast of Burst Fire or Ultrashock Laser that critically strikes . Spark Surge resets Zeri's basic attack timer and Burst Fire's cooldown. Ultrashock Laser and Lightning Crash can be cast during the dash. Link ▶️ "Gotta zip!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted Spark Surge's extended dash travels based on the thickness of the terrain, up to a maximum distance.

If this hits at least one enemy champion, she enters Overcharged for 5 seconds. Hitting an enemy champion with an ability or charged basic attack will extend the duration by 1. 5 seconds, up to its original duration. Magic Damage: 175 / 275 / 375 (+ 85% bonus AD) (+ 110% AP) Overcharged: Zeri gains 30% bonus attack speed and 10% bonus movement speed . Burst Fire is empowered to have a 20% shorter cast time and instead fire 3 rounds that travel with increased speed and chain to the nearest visible enemy within 650 units of the target, up to 4 subsequent targets, to deal 25% AD physical damage . This damage can critically strike for (18. 75 % + 10% ) AD bonus physical damage . During Overcharged , Zeri can generate stacks of Hypercharged from enemy champions that last 1. 5 seconds. She generates 1 stack for each one she hits with an ability or charged basic attack, increased to 3 on abilities that critically strike . Subsequent hits refresh the duration of Hypercharged . Burst Fire grants stacks only against the first target hit. Hypercharged: For each stack, Zeri gains 0. 5 % bonus movement speed . Link ▶️ "Lightning crash!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Physical / Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Not Blocked Zeri can move while casting Lightning Crash , and it does not interrupt her previous orders. Zeri can stack Overcharge up to 100,000 times. Applies area damage for the nova and proc damage for the bonus magic damage and physical damage. Spell shield blocks Lightning Crash's initial nova but does not prevent Zeri from becoming Overcharged . It does not block Burst Fire's electricity chain. Clones count for granting Overcharge . Lightning Crash's and Spark Surge's empowerments to Burst Fire can combine together. Burst Fire electricity chain will not chain across structures. If Zeri enters resurrection during Overcharge , she will lose all stacks of the effect but Overcharge will not end prematurely. (bug) She cannot gain stacks again after reviving while the buff is active. (bug) This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
