Innervating Locket became very popular after it was used on Udyr by summoner 'Guardsman Bob' during the Ionia vs Noxus showmatch, which prompted its removal a week later ( Ryan 'Morello' Scott clarified the removal had been planned before the match) In the 20 th Summoner Showcase, Nika 'Nikasaur' Harper linked a video by YouTuber 'GeneralCacti' about Udyr's synergy with Innervating Locket. The changes in patch V1.0.0.101 were likely made to prevent Sona from abusing the item. Its eventual removal was most likely due to it becoming a source of near-infinite sustain for champions with low ability cooldowns (Udyr in particular). Numerous times was Innervating Locket rumored to be reintroduced (at GamesCom 2011, before Season 2012 started) but it never did and was replaced by Locket of the Iron Solari . On Nexus Blitz's release, streamer Hashinshin requested via Twitter that Innervating Locket be reintroduced (his post must hit 4444 retweets to be added in).
