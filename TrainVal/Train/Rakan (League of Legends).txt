Original View in 3D 975 18.04.2017 As mercurial as he is charming, Rakan is an infamous vastayan troublemaker and the greatest battle-dancer in Lhotlan tribal history. To the humans of the Ionian highlands, his name has long been synonymous with wild festivals, uncontrollable parties, and anarchic music. Few would suspect this energetic, traveling showman is also partner to the rebel Xayah, and is dedicated to her cause.

The pair were then resurrected and turned against their allies -- a fact Rakan seems keenly aware of. Biding his time to strike, he has a plan to purify the darkness from Xayah's heart... though the price may be losing himself to evil forever.

Star-crossed lovers uninterested in the affairs of mortals, their playful romance has insulated their people from the horrors befalling the outside world.

They were also the first champions released in 2017 . Rakan's and Xayah's loading screens always align themselves to the rightmost side before a game starts and when picked on the same team (to mirror their shared splash art). Rakan's cloak is actually his wings disguised by Vastayan magic in order to blend in with humans. Rakan and Xayah are sometimes depicted together with combined wings. The one-winged Jian bird in Chinese mythology has a similar codependency, which represents the bond of two lovers. Rakan has the second highest basic attack range amongst melee champions (300 units) behind Lillia (325 units). He used to have the lowest basic attack range amongst ranged champions prior to V12.22 . Rakan's favorite human food is chocolate; even though chocolate's theobromine may poison Rakan due to his half-bird physiology, his human half may help metabolize the compound & alleviate its effects. Rakan's dance references Jailhouse Rock by Elvis Presley . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. He shared this dance with Pantheon , until the latter eventually got a full relaunch. When Rakan basic attacks from a far distance he hits his target with his cape, if he is closer, he will punch them instead. At release, Rakan had a hidden passive: he also dealt 1 more physical damage with his punches. [2] His name resembles the Malay noun rakan "friend, relative"; He is the only champion with 3 points at 3 skills by the client classification.
