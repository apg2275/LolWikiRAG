Friend Request You can now block players in the Friend Request popup. MMR Restrictions In patch 12.10, we'll be testing a change to duo queue around Apex Tiers for KR and NA regions only. Having a premade duo is a slight advantage, and while current Apex Tier players aren't able to duo with anyone, the system only works off current rank. With this change, we're tightening up the Apex Tier restriction to apply to MMR as well. The goal of this is to prevent climbing smurfs from being able to duo queue into Apex tier. That said, decayed Apex Tier players and the highest skilled Diamond I players may also be impacted by this change. Up until now these players could duo and reliably get into Apex Tier games, which isn't fair when the people they're playing against can't duo. If this change works as expected, we'll evaluate shipping it to the rest of the world with plans to re-evaluate before Season Start. Your Shop Your Shop is back from April 28th 2022 to May 30th 2022.
