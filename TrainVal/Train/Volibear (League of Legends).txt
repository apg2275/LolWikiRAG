At 5 stacks, Volibear gains Lightning Claws . The Relentless Storm: For each stack, Volibear gains 5% (+ 4% per 100 AP) bonus attack speed , up to 25% (+ 20% per 100 AP) . Lightning Claws: Volibear's claws ignite with lightning, empowering his basic attacks on-hit to deal 11 − 60 (based on level) (+ 50% AP) bonus magic damage to the target and the nearest visible enemy within 450 units of the target, chaining up to 4 subsequent targets. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Default damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked See Notes Not Blocked Volibear's spikes visually grow as The Relentless Storm stacks. Stacks of The Relentless Storm are also granted on-hit , but will specifically not be if the target is invulnerable . While at four stacks, the next attack or ability on-hit reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by Lightning Claws . A stack of The Relentless Storm is not gained if the attack is dodged and/or missed if Volibear is blinded . A stack is granted even if the attack is blocked . In all cases, Lightning Claws will not apply (on-hit damage is parried and the bounce is prevented). Since Frenzied Maul cannot be missed while Volibear is blinded , gaining stacks from The Relentless Storm and applying Lighting Claws from the ability will not be prevented from that parry effect. Volibear has a hidden passive that grants him 1 armor for every enemy Zilean within 800 range of him. Likewise, Zilean gains 1 ability power for every nearby Volibear . Neither Volibear nor Zilean need sight of one another to gain these bonuses. The empowered attacks do not affect structures nor wards . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Lightning AP ratio changed to 40% AP . Edit Thundering Smash Thundering Smash COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN : 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: none Active: Volibear drops on all fours, becoming ghosted and gaining bonus movement speed for 4 seconds, doubled while facing a visible enemy champion within 2000 units. Bonus Movement Speed: 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24% Increased Bonus Movement Speed: 16 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48% During this time, Volibear's next basic attack is empowered to consume the bonus movement speed to have an uncancellable windup , gain 25 bonus range , and pounce on the target , dealing bonus physical damage and stunning them for 1 second. Bonus Physical Damage: 10 / 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 (+ 120% bonus AD) If Volibear becomes immobilized or polymorphed by an enemy during Thundering Smash , the effect ends prematurely and the cooldown is reset. Thundering Smash's bonus damage is affected by critical strike modifiers and applies life steal at 100% effectiveness. Thundering Smash resets Volibear's basic attack timer.

Thundering Smash deals basic damage , but also triggers spell effects by dealing an additional 0 spell damage . Thundering Smash will still apply its effects to the target even if the dash is interrupted , but not if he goes into resurrection . Thundering Smash can dash over walls provided Volibear is in attack range of his target on the other side. Thundering Smash's attack triggers against structures and wards , consuming the effect but dealing its bonus damage, if applicable. The windup for the attack completes even if the target becomes untargetable but the stun and damage do not apply. Thundering Smash's reset does not trigger from drowsy and is only granted after falling asleep . The player's screen will flash red briefly and cue a sound effect when Volibear becomes immobilized while Thundering Smash is active. Volibear's next attack after using Thundering Smash will come out faster. Despite being an empowered attack, Thundering Smash does not draw minion aggro.

Despite being single target, Frenzied Maul does not draw minion aggro. (bug) If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Edit Sky Splitter Sky Splitter COST: 60 Mana COOLDOWN: 13 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 1200 EFFECT RADIUS: 325 / 425 Active: Volibear summons a lightning bolt to strike at the target location after a 2-second delay, granting sight of the area for 1 second after one second has passed. If Volibear is within the strike, he gains a shield equal to 14% of his maximum health (+ 75% AP) for 3 seconds. The bolt deals magic damage to enemies hit, capped at 650 against non-champions, and slows them by 40% for 2 seconds.

Edit Stormbringer Stormbringer COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 160 / 140 / 120 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 700 EFFECT RADIUS: 300 / 500 / 700 SPEED: 750 Active: Volibear gains Stormbringer for 12 seconds and leaps to the target location with crowd control immunity , granting sight of the area in a 500 radius during the travel. Stormbringer: Volibear gains ghosting , bonus health , 50 bonus attack range , 25 increased range on Frenzied Maul , and 35% increased size . Bonus Health: 175 / 350 / 525 Volibear impacts after 1 second, slowing nearby enemies by 50% decaying over 1 second. Enemies within the epicenter are also dealt physical damage . Physical Damage: 300 / 500 / 700 (+ 250% bonus AD) (+ 125% AP) Volibear also disables enemy turrets in an area for a duration, rendering them unable to attack, as well as dealing them the same damage . Turret Disable Duration: 3 / 4 / 5 Stormbringer will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Thundering Smash's duration will be paused for the leap . Link ▶️ I am the storm! Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Not Interrupted Stormbringer will disable any turret that is not the Nexus Obelisk , even if it is untargetable . Stormbringer will not deal damage to untargetable turrets. Volibear grows to his new size over 1. 25 seconds, starting 0. 25 seconds after landing, and shrinks back to his normal size over 0. 5 seconds after Stormbinger's status ends, respectively. Volibear leaps over 1 second regardless of distance or movement speed . Volibear impacts immediately at his current location if Stormbringer is cast over terrain he cannot pass through (due to not being able to cover the distance required). (bug) The additional bonuses are granted on-cast. The turret disable debuff is named Ohmwrecker . Disabling a turret does not prevent aggro of the current target it is locked onto. The increased turret shot damage from Ohmwrecker is also reset. Turrets maintain the same targeting behavior even when disabled; damaging an enemy champion will still draw turret aggro. However, if the turret's desired target leaves range or has become an invalid target, it will lock onto the most previous target it was going to attack prior to becoming disabled, or instead, find a new one if that condition is not applicable.

For all associated collection items, see Volibear (Collection) . Original View in 3D 880 29.11.2011 To those who still revere him, the Volibear is the storm made manifest. Destructive, wild, and stubbornly resolute, he existed before mortals walked the Freljord’s tundra, and is fiercely protective of the lands that he and his demi-god kin created. Cultivating a deep hatred of civilization and the weakness it brought with it, he now fights to return to the old ways—when the land was untamed, and blood spilled freely—and eagerly battles all who oppose him, with tooth, claw, and thundering domination. David Sobolov Alex 'alexplank' Flores Loot eligible Thunder Lord View in 3D 520 29.11.2011 In an age before man, King Voli ruled the bitter northlands, and he was as harsh and unforgiving as they were. It is said that he waged a terrible war against his brother, the great King Ornn, and that their struggle razed mountains and emptied seas, as the two of them became like beasts themselves.

For his utter incompetence in the field, it was made certain he would remain on desk duty for the rest of his career. Even so, he and Constable Trundle always end up patrolling the streets with mountains of paperwork left in their wake.

One: he is definitely a bear, and not a man dressed as a bear, as some might claim. Two: bears make amazing wrestlers. David Sobolov Kelly Aleshire Luchador Loot eligible The Thousand-Pierced Bear View in 3D 975 28.05.2020 Ancient Freljordian legends speak of spirit walkers consumed by the true spirit of the unrelenting bear—a force older than the Freljord itself.

David Sobolov Choe HeonHwa Coven Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Duality Dragon View in 3D 1350 21.10.2021 Volibear was the greatest terror in the forest, until the nearby volcano erupted. In the frenzy of escape, Volibear came across a child who was similarly trapped, and heeded a strange instinct—he saved the child. The Duality Dragon saw and made the mighty predator an offer: the power to hone the duality of his nature, both fury and compassion.

Balance is an active struggle; each day the predator and protector clash, and each day Volibear's will grows stronger by the grace of the dragon's gift.

Whether his charges succeed in taking revenge or meet violent ends, each one who dies gives him more power. More power means more wayward mortals seek him out for contracts—and thus the bear will never go hungry.

He was named after Travis 'Volibar' George , from a long running forum meme of him supporting armored bears in the League. [2] Volibar comes from Basque bolu "mill" and ibar "valley". [3] This demi-god's preferred epithet Valhir is possibly based on unattested Old Norse * Val hyrr [4] [5] "fire of the battle-slain"; valr "battle-slain" is also found in Valhalla "hall of the battle-slain" and Valkyrie "chooser of the battle-slain". His other epithet the Volibear possibly also contains a variant of valr . His Ursine tribe possibly references on real-world bear worship and the norse Berserker . Volibear might have been inspired by the Panserbjørne (Danish/Norwegian: 'armored bears') from His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman . Volibear's dance both before and after his visual update references Sam B's dance in America's Got Talent . A side-by-side comparison from before his update can be seen here . A side-by-side comparison from after his update can be seen here . In Volibear's ' Champion Spotlight ', his release skin names were erroneously used to label the opposite one (i.e. ' Thunder Lord ' was on ' Northern Storm ' and vice versa). Rolling Thunder might be referencing the eponymous piece by Henry Fillmore and/or Operation Rolling Thunder from the Vietnam War .
