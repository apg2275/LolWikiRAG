Should list everything (probably no LOL) or only examples? Have a page that lists everything? (probably yes) Actual page sketch: On-Action effects is a catch-all term for additional effects that are triggered from other actions such as basic attacking, casting a spell, applying crowd control, dealing damage, etc. Units can be either the one "dealing" the effect, or "taking" them. Mention invulnerability here or in their specifics? Contents 1 On-Attack 2 On-Cast 3 On-Crowd Control 4 On-Crit 5 On-Damage 6 On-Death 7 On-Hit 8 On-Healing/Shielding 9 On-Spell On-Attack [ ] On-attack effects are triggered whenever the unit starts their basic attack, or when they finish their wind up, and as of patch x.y, abilities that apply on-hit effects are also special cased to do so. - list examples by on wind up complete, on attack start, on-hit, etc? Examples dealing On-Attack DMG Kayle's Zealous' and fire waves (completing wind up) Yone's Way of the Hunter (switching blades) Rolling critical strike (on start) Examples taking On-Attack DMG: N/A On-Cast [ ] On-cast effects are triggered whenever a unit casts their abilities. Some are applied at the start of the cast time, while others at the end. Abilities with multiple activations may behave differently, since not all activations can apply on-cast effects. For more information see this page . Examples dealing On-Cast DMG Annie's Pyromania (stacking) Lucian's Lightslinger Spellblade (gaining the buff) Examples taking On-Cast DMG: Kassadin's Force Pulse On-Crowd Control [ ] multiple categories? is there anything that triggers on CC that is not part of immobilization ? Movement impairment? (immobilization + slow and cripple) Examples dealing On-CC DMG: Aftershock (immobilizations) Examples taking On-CC DMG: Volibear Thundering Smash (immobilizations) On-Crit [ ] Examples dealing On-Crit DMG: Tryndamere's Spinning Slash (Cooldown reduction, On-hit hybrid too apparently) Examples taking On-Crit DMG: Randuin VFX (old, time to delete this one) On-Damage [ ] On-Damage effects are triggered whenever a damage instance is successfully landed. Note: Invulnerability , dodge , and Blind causes the damage instance to be skipped, resulting in not triggering any on damage effect. Blocking does not skip the damage event, instead it reduces it to zero. Because of this, on damage effects are still triggered. Examples dealing On-DMG: Darius' Hemorrhage (stacking bleed, exception: Decimate's inner radius) Mordekaiser's Darkness Rise (the 3 unique hits has to deal damage) (actually test rageblade, goldfish memory) Conqueror (stacking) Examples taking On-DMG: Doran's Shield (health-regen) Second Wind Bone Plating On-Death [ ] On-Death effects are triggered whenever a unit kills, and in some occasions assists, or gets killed. Examples dealing On-Death: Sion's Soul Furnace (passive health stacking) Master Yi's Highlander (passive cooldown refund) Triumph Presence of Mind Examples taking On-death: Resurrections Dispel Zombie state On-Hit [ ] On-hit effects are triggered simultaneously after the applying damage applies to the affected enemy. Basic attacks apply on-hit effects by default. Some abilities, especially those that are calculated as auto attacks themselves will also benefit from the damage increases On-Hit allows. Note: Invulnerability , dodge , and Blind will negate the effects damage from would-be damaging instances from On-hit [et. all]. Blocking does not negate completely, but instead will skip the additional damage instances until it it is reduced to zero. At which point, On-Hit [et. all] will apply additionally when the shield's prevention ends. Master Yi's Wuju Style is an exceptional case: It deals true damge On-Hit, a damage type that cannot be reduced normally. Because of that, the true damage won't be reduced to zero by block (but the triggering attack will be regardless when attacking a shielded target). Interaction: Guinsoo's Rageblade Phantom Hit repeats all on-hits after a short delay (but not on-attacks). Both dealing and taking benefits from this. Note: Single use on-hits, such as Spellblade, are not repeated Examples dealing On-Hit DMG: Akali's Assassin's Mark Warwick's Eternal Hunger Wit's End Spellblade (consuming the effect) Examples taking On-Hit DMG: Annie's Molten Shield Amumu's Tantrum (cooldown refund) Rammus' Defensive Ball Curl Thornmail Abilities that trigger On-Hit and On-Attack damage? asd asd asd asd asd asd On-Healing/Shielding [ ] Examples dealing On-Healing/Shielding: Aery, Ardent Summon Aery Ardent Censer Examples taking On-Healing/Shielding: Seraphine W interaction (?) On-Spell [ ] On-Spell effects trigger whenever an ability lands, identical to On-Hit for auto attacks. Not all damaging props from On-Spell are abilities. Examples dealing On-Spell DMG: Luden, pre-season has a LOT of them in theory Examples taking Om-Spell DMG: Maokai I Maokai's Sap Magic
