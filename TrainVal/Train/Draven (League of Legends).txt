Spinning Axe will place a visual cue on the ground where it will land. This visual cue is visible to both teams, although Draven himself will see a more prominent marker. Recasting Spinning Axe will refresh the buff and add another axe if possible. There is no limit to how many axes can be juggled at once, just the limit of 2 of them at a time in Draven's hands. Draven used to be able to catch (steal) an enemy Draven' s axes. This event also prompted a few unique voice lines. Spinning Axes may optically bypass Wind Wall and Blade Whirl but they will be destroyed upon collision. Unbreakable will not prevent the axe from bouncing off when Braum is the target. Unbreakable will not prevent the axe from bouncing off when Braum is not the target. The axe will still bounce against parrying effects.

Original View in 3D 880 05.06.2012 In Noxus, warriors known as reckoners face one another in arenas where blood is spilled and strength tested—but none has ever been as celebrated as Draven. A former soldier, he found that the crowds uniquely appreciated his flair for the dramatic, not to mention the spray of blood from each of his spinning axes. Addicted to the spectacle of his own brash perfection, Draven has sworn to defeat whomever he must to ensure that his name is chanted throughout the empire forever more. Erik Braa Andrew 'Silver' Silver Loot eligible Soul Reaver View in 3D 1350 05.06.2012 As arrogant in undeath as he was in life, Draven torments those of the underworld with a penchant for terror and style.

Erik Braa Sixmorevodka Studio Pool Party Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Beast Hunter View in 3D 750 04.02.2016 In addition to being one of the best beast hunters on the mainland, Draven is a master of the spinning blade, and also an incorrigible showboat. This quality has led to many of his hunting partners being eaten, which he likes because it causes dramatic tension.
