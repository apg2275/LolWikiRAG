Old icons 1st version 2nd version Last version (Muramana (Quick Charge)) Trivia Muramana can be viewed inside the shop as an unpurchaseable upgrade to Manamune , this is also true for Seraph's Embrace and Fimbulwinter . The name Muramana seems to be based on Muramasa , a sword made by a famous Japanese swordsmith. Muramana was the first item to have an ability toggle (now known as its second passive, Shock). The ability toggle could be a reconstruction of the old passive of Wit's End . Prior to V3.03 , Kassadin's Nether Blade would trigger the damage on each attack while active. The Quick Charge version was also used on the Crystal Scar during Rotating Game Modes . Skarner's Crystal Venom uses the same sound effects as Muramana's shock.
