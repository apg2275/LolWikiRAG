Magic Damage: 70 / 105 / 140 / 175 / 210 (+ 75% AP) When the blasts meet, the gusts form a tornado that persists for 2 seconds, slowly moving forward and dealing magic damage equal to 「 2. 5 % (+ 1% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health every 0. 5 seconds 」 「 10% (+ 4% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health over the duration 」 to enemies within the area, capped at 「 150 per tick 」 「 600 total 」 against monsters .

Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins. For all associated collection items, see Galio (Collection) . Original View in 3D 790 10.08.2010 Outside the gleaming city of Demacia, the stone colossus Galio keeps vigilant watch. Built as a bulwark against enemy mages, he often stands motionless for decades until the presence of powerful magic stirs him to life. Once activated, Galio makes the most of his time, savoring the thrill of a fight and the rare honor of defending his countrymen. But his triumphs are always bittersweet, for the magic he destroys is also his source of reanimation, and each victory leaves him dormant once again.

While he is ostensibly a walking advertisement, the protective creature is both curious about the world, and proud of his responsibility. Josh Petersdorf Bo 'chenbowow' Chen Hextech Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Commando View in 3D 520 18.01.2011 Issues with the military industrial complex notwithstanding, why would a government put all its petricite resources into a giant statue that punches things? Or a pair of sunglasses big enough for one to wear? Josh Petersdorf Mist XG Commando Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Gatekeeper View in 3D 1820 23.04.2012 One of the great dukes of Hell, Galio stands before his kingdom's black gates as the judge of all sinners, casting souls into their proper torments. Attempting to invoke him generally ends in tragedy, as he's several hundred feet tall and refuses to shrink in the service of mortals.

Tricked by the mad knight Kayle so she could destroy every clutch of eggs under his charge, he has followed her back to human society, so he might exact his vengeance personally.

Yet each year he is bested, as the story goes, so when Irelia comes to him and tells him that their fates are not writ in stone, Galio listens. If helping her means crafting a new future, he will lend her all his beastly strength.

The name Galileo means "man of Galilee ", ultimately from Semitic root g-l "to roll". [2] Galio's dance references Beauty and the Beast by Walt Disney . Galio, the Colossus Galio retains his dance post- rework , which references Beauty and the Beast by Walt Disney. He references his previous alias while attacking a Blue Sentinel : "You're a sentinel? I'm a sentinel! We should fight!" In this case however, this interaction has literal implications: Galio being a textbook-definition sentinel for Demacia, and Galio perhaps sharing similar origins with the Blue Sentinel, both being rock/mineral beings empowered/given life by magic.
