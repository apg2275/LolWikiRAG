Notes The upgrade from Wriggle's Lantern to Feral Flare removes the monster-only restriction on Maim in addition to the new stacking effect, and substantially increases the cast range on the active. Unlike life steal , on-hit healing is not countered by armor and invulnerability . As such, Feral Flare is a strong sustain option when facing high-armor targets such as Rammus , Malphite and Baron Nashor . Maim's bonus damage does not take into account any kills, assists or large monsters slain prior to obtaining Feral Flare - i.e. the bonus damage will always begin at 75. [1] Trivia The name "Feral Flare" is possibly derived from "FeralPony" (Riot game designer). The Feral stack buff's tooltip also alludes to this. However note that "feral" is also a synonym to "wild", thus Feral Flare could simply be a reference to both the jungle and jungling. During the Season 4 Preseason, this item's passive was originally going to be given to a remade Madred's Bloodrazor . For comparison, Feral Flare's magic damage equal to 4% of the target's maximum health against champions with 625 (+25 per Feral Stack) health. For example: at 95 kills/assists/large monsters slain you will be doing 120 bonus magic damage to champions (4% of a target with 3000 health).
