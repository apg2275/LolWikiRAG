Glaive Warrior Pantheon PVP.net V1.60 [ ] Changes to normal draft mode were not implemented and were deployed with V1.0.0.141 . Normal Draft Mode: Normal draft has changed so that premade groups are not prioritized over solo players. Solo players have a 20% chance of being the team captain with banning powers and first pick, regardless of the premade status of the rest of the team. If a solo player is not team captain, the player will be given a random slot in the pick order. If players group up before a game, their host absorbs all of their chances, i.e. the host of a 4-man premade has an 80% chance to be captain.

Fixed a bug where the sound at the end of champion select would play too loudly. Fixed a bug where swap offers in champion select would persist into your next game.
