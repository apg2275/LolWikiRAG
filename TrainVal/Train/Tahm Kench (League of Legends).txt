Stacks expire by one every 0. 67 seconds when the duration ends. Tongue Lash and Devour gain additional effects against enemies with 3 stacks, consuming them all. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Parries Blocked The passive bonus damage applies to turrets. Edit Tongue Lash Tongue Lash COST: 50 / 46 / 42 / 38 / 34 Mana COOLDOWN: 7 / 6. 5 / 6 / 5. 5 / 5 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 900 WIDTH: 140 SPEED: 2800 Active: Tahm Kench lashes his tongue in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first enemy hit and slows them by 50% for 2 seconds. If this hits an enemy champion , Tahm Kench also heals himself. Magic Damage: 80 / 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 (+ 100% AP) (+ 6 − 48 (based on level) ( + 2% AP per 100 bonus health ) (+ 4% bonus health) ) Heal: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 (+ 5 / 5. 5 / 6 / 6. 5 / 7% of missing health) An Acquired Taste Bonus: The target is stunned for 1. 5 seconds. Devour can be cast during Tongue Lash at no cost to pull the target to Tahm Kench before swallowing them. Tahm Kench is unable to move, attack, or cast Abyssal Dive or Devour on a different target while his tongue is in flight. Tongue Lash's range and travel speed can be increased by Tahm Kench's size . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Tongue Lash's range and speed scale 1:1 alongside any size modifiers to Tahm Kench , but will not be reduced below their base values if his overall size modifier is smaller than 100%. As the missile range and speed scale simultaneously, Tongue Lash will always take 0. 33 seconds to reach its maximum range (no matter the cast range). Because of this, increasing Tahm Kench's size with items such as Elixir of Iron allows him to hit targets at even the same distance more quickly and giving them less time to dodge. Devour can be 'queued' at any point during Tongue Lash (including the wind-up animation) and will not go on cooldown if Tahm Kench fails to hit a valid target with Tongue Lash . All three An Acquired Taste stacks will be consumed even if Tongue Lash's stun is negated. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.

Abyssal Dive grants sight of the area during the channel. Tahm Kench emerges to deal magic damage to nearby enemies, as well as knock up and stun them for 1 second. If this hits at least one enemy champion , 40% of Abyssal Dive's mana cost as well as a percentage of its cooldown are refunded. Magic Damage: 100 / 135 / 170 / 205 / 240 (+ 150% AP) Cooldown Refund: 40 / 42. 5 / 45 / 47. 5 / 50% Enemies can see the indicator for Tahm Kench's destination after he has channeled for 0. 75 seconds. Abyssal Dive will cast at max range if cast beyond that. "Boy, the world's one river, and I'm its king. Ain't no place I ain't been; ain't no place I can't go again."

He can store up to 300% of his maximum health . Damage Stored into Grey Health: 13 / 21 / 29 / 37 / 45% Increased Damage Stored into Grey Health: 40 / 42. 5 / 45 / 47. 5 / 50% While Thick Skin is not on cooldown, and after 4 seconds without taking damage, Tahm Kench rapidly consumes his grey health to restore 45% − 100% (based on level) of the amount, healing for 10% of his maximum health every 0. 264 seconds . Active: Tahm Kench converts his current grey health into a shield that lasts for 2. 5 seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Thick Skin shield value and grey health percentage heal are both boosted by effects that increase heal and shield power. This means Tahm Kench can technically heal more than the normal amount of grey health and get a shield bigger than his maximum health. At level 18 Tahm Kench would need 53. 8 % heal power to heal for 100% of the damage he takes, reduced to 34. 9 % with Revitalize , 23. 1 % with Spirit Visage , and 6. 9 % with both. Grey health converts all post-mitigation damage, Thick Skin effectively grants Tahm Kench a form of true damage mitigation. Grey health can temporarily exceed 100% of his missing health when Tahm Kench heals through other means with a grey health bar at 100%. In that case he will keep the higher grey health value for a few moments until it updates and removes the amount that he healed. Edit Devour Devour COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 250 Active: Tahm Kench swallows the target champion for up to 3 seconds, rendering them untargetable and displacement immune . Devour can be cast on enemies only with 3 stacks of An Acquired Taste . If the target is an ally, they become unable to act and are granted a shield , which decays in strength by 50 every 0. 25 seconds after they are Regurgitated . Tahm Kench will also gain 40% bonus movement speed for 3 seconds and is unable to cast movement spells besides Abyssal Dive while an ally is swallowed. Shield Strength: 650 / 800 / 950 (+ 150% AP) After 1 second, Tahm Kench can cast Regurgitate within the duration, and automatically does so afterwards. The swallowed ally can also input a movement command to force this cast in the target direction, unless they are immobilized . An Acquired Taste Bonus: The target is suppressed while swallowed. Tahm Kench will also be grounded and slowed by 40% while an enemy is swallowed. If Tahm Kench is performing Abyssal Dive , Regurgitate will not automatically cast until after he finishes. Edit Regurgitate Regurgitate CAST TIME: 0. 25 Active: Tahm Kench spits the swallowed champion in the target direction. If they are an enemy, he deals magic damage to them at the end of the displacement. Magic Damage: 100 / 250 / 400 (+ 15% (+ 7% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health) Hide Devour Details Regurgitate Details Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Counters Spell shield Blocked Notes Devour will end prematurely under the following circumstances: The enemy target cleanses the suppression . Tahm Kench or his target dies. If he dies during the cast time, the target will be dealt Regurgitate's damage. Tahm Kench enters resurrection . If he enters resurrection during the cast time, the target will be dealt Regurgitate's damage. Tahm Kench or his target enters or leaves the Realm of Death . If the caster of that ability enters the realm, they will be Regurgitated instead. Devour cannot be used on allies that are channeling or using an ability that preloads UnstoppableForceMarker . Devour's swallow will be resisted by enemies that are displacement immune . The target becomes untargetable and displacement immune on-cast. Enemy targets will become suppressed on-cast. If the target cleanses the suppression during the cast time they will not be swallowed at the end of the cast time. Swallowed enemy champions will receive the recast's damage regardless of how they exit. The self-slow is affected by slow resist . Tahm Kench cannot use gates during Devour . Allies can see if this spell is ready next to Tahm Kench's health bar. The swallowed target is not considered to be vanished . They are instead hidden underground to maintain ongoing effects such as Senna's Curse of the Black Mist . The following table refers for interactions while the target is unable to act: Attacking Disabled Abilities Disabled Movement If an ally, forces Tahm Kench to use Regurgitate unless movement commands are otherwise restricted. If an enemy, movement commands are disabled.

Original View in 3D 880 08.07.2015 Known by many names throughout history, the demon Tahm Kench travels the waterways of Runeterra, feeding his insatiable appetite with the misery of others. Though he may appear singularly charming and proud, he swaggers through the physical realm like a vagabond in search of unsuspecting prey. His lashing tongue can stun even a heavily armored warrior from a dozen paces, and to fall into his rumbling belly is to tumble into an abyss from which there is little hope of return. Pat Duke Pan Chengwei Loot eligible Master Chef View in 3D 975 08.07.2015 He's the sushi singer, the loquacious pescatarian, the big catfish with a big fish dish.

Though his targets are almost always left destitute, with the proper reverence and careful wording it is possible to escape his bargains unimaginably wealthy.

He don't need no compensation. She'll just owe him a favor… because in the End, it pays to have friends.

Upon Jhin's release from his waterfall prison, a magical pearl was unearthed at its base, catching both Tahm's and Kog'Maw's eyes. Snatching it first, Tahm transformed into a dragon god of currents and unleashed a maelstrom of startling ferocity, laughing at the ensuing destruction.

At first it was thought the gambler and his bride were Tobias and Evelynn ( Twisted Fate's cards went blank and featured an unknown cursive script in his official champion page; however, Twisted Fate and the original Tahm Kench , whose identity the malevolent River King usurped, are not the same. [2] Tahm Kench's dance has him play the tune he hums in 'The River King' with his tongue ( Rift Scuttler will join him if he dances near her). Tahm Kench's design and playstyle may be loosely based on the Banderhobb, a toad-like creature from the Forgotten Realms universe which kidnaps unsuspecting victims by swallowing them alive and carrying them to its master's lair. In VALORANT on the Ascent map (Mid Bottom), there is a park bench crafted with his likeness. This is most likely a reference to the "Unbench the Kench" meme.
