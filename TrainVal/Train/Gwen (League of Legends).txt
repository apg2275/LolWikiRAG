Active: Gwen snips at least twice with her scissors in a cone in the target direction over the cast time, dealing magic damage per snip to all enemies within the area, with the final snip dealing increased damage. The center of each snip converts 50% of the damage to true damage , then applies Thousand Cuts .

Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic / True Counters Spell shield See Notes Subsequent basic attacks on-hit also refresh the duration of Snippy stacks. The amount of Snippy stacks Gwen has is indicated below her health bar . Spell shield blocks only one snip. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. The first snip happens at 0. 13 seconds , the last one at the end of the cast time. Bonus snips from Snippy stacks each happen at 0. 45 , 0. 4 , 0. 35 and 0. 23 seconds into the cast time. Edit Hallowed Mist Hallowed Mist COST: 60 mana COOLDOWN : 22 / 21 / 20 / 19 / 18 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 480 SPEED: 2000 Active: Gwen summons the Hallowed Mist upon her current location, lasting for 4 seconds. Hallowed Mist can be recast after 0. 5 seconds, and does so automatically if Gwen attempts to leave the area. While inside the mist, Gwen gains bonus armor and bonus magic resistance and is untargetable to all enemies (except turrets and monsters ) outside of the mist. Bonus Resistances: 22 / 24 / 26 / 28 / 30 (+ 7% AP) Recast: Gwen commands the mist to move to her current location. Gwen negates all attacks by monsters outside of the mist. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Hallowed Mist's untargetability does not apply to monsters nor turrets , meaning they are allowed to gain aggro against Gwen and attack her regardless of being in the mist or not. However, Gwen will not take damage from monsters that hit her and are outside of the mist. Hallowed Mist does not grant untargetability against enemy pets inside the zone even if their source is not. All projectiles targeted at Gwen by enemy champions outside the mist are destroyed upon attempting to pass through the mist or being inside the mist. Targeted projectiles sourced by minions or monsters will not be destroyed and can still hit Gwen even if they are outside of the zone. If Gwen dashes out of the area, the mist will automatically move to the dash's destination instead of Gwen's location. The mist will stop moving immediately if the dash is interrupted. The recast will move the mist's center 75 units through Gwen's location at the time. If she is dashing , the mist will move 75 units through her dash destination instead. The mist will teleport to Gwen's location if she blinks a far distance. Enemy champions outside the mist are indicated with a broken sword. Hallowed Mist will indicate that Gwen is Immune whenever an effect attempts to hit Gwen . Edit Skip 'n Slash Skip 'n Slash COST: 35 Mana COOLDOWN: 13 / 12. 5 / 12 / 11. 5 / 11 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 350 / 450 Active: Gwen dashes to the target location, then empowers her basic attacks within the next 4 seconds to deal 15 (+ 20% AP) bonus magic damage on-hit and gain bonus attack speed and 75 bonus attack range . Bonus Attack Speed: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80% Gwen's first basic attack within the duration refunds a portion of Skip 'n Slash's cooldown . Cooldown Refund: 25 / 35 / 45 / 55 / 65% Skip 'n Slash resets Gwen's basic attack timer, and can be cast during any of her abilities, and vice versa. Skip 'n Slash will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted Skip 'n Slash has no minimum dash range. The basic attack reset is not considered one for Hail of Blades . (bug) Edit Needlework Needlework COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 25 / 0. 5 RANGE: -100 + 1350 WIDTH: 240 to 0 SPEED: 1800 Active: Gwen launches a needle in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies hit and slows them for 1. 5 seconds. Magic Damage per Needle: 35 / 65 / 95 (+ 10% AP) Damage with Thousand Cuts : 35 / 65 / 95 (+ 10% AP) (+ 1% (+ 0. 72 % per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health) Slow: 40 / 50 / 60% Needlework can be recast twice more within 6 seconds of the activation at no additional cost, with a 1-second static cooldown between casts. Each subsequent cast refreshes the duration and increases the number of needles launched by 2. Needle hits beyond the first slow by a reduced amount against each individual target. Reduced Slow: 15 / 20 / 25% Recast: Gwen mimics the first cast's effects, while barraging three needles on the second cast and five on the third cast. Second Cast Total Damage: 105 / 195 / 285 (+ 30% AP) (+ 3% (+ 2. 16 % per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health) Third Cast Total Damage: 175 / 325 / 475 (+ 50% AP) (+ 5% (+ 5% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health) Maximum Total Damage: 315 / 585 / 855 (+ 90% AP) (+ 9% (+ 6. 48 % per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health) Link ▶️ "Needles out!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Details Gwen can still move during Needlework's cast times. Dying during the cast time will prevent the remaining needles of the cast from being launched. The first cast's cast time is 0. 25 seconds, and the second and third's cast times are each 0. 5 seconds. Gwen launches the needles during the cast times. For the second cast, the first needle launches 0. 264 seconds after the start of the cast, the second needle launches after 0. 132 seconds , and the third needle launches 0. 231 seconds after the first. For the third cast, the first needle launches 0. 264 seconds after the start of the cast. Each additional needle launches 0. 066 seconds seconds after the previous one. The needles of each cast will fire based on Gwen's location at 0. 264 seconds into each cast time (in case of the first cast, this is at the end of the cast time). The needles fire from 100 units behind the cast location. The width of all needle missiles decreases with their distance travelled, forming an approximately triangular missile hitbox. Needles of the same cast all travel the same line at a slight delay after one another. The visual origins are offset (by 70 and 110 units to either side from the center missile spawn location), but the actual hitting missiles all follow the central line. Spell shield blocks only one needle. Needlework is placed on a 0. 1 -second cooldown when the cast time completes and when Gwen gains a recast (before gaining a recast via the attack, the recast remains sealed even while not on cooldown). This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins.

Original View in 3D 975 15.04.2021 A former doll transformed and brought to life by magic, Gwen wields the very tools that once created her. She carries the weight of her maker's love with every step, taking nothing for granted. At her command is the Hallowed Mist, an ancient and protective magic that has blessed Gwen's scissors, needles, and sewing thread. So much is new to her, but Gwen remains joyfully determined to fight for the good that survives in a broken world. Abby Trott Jeremy 'Jermu' Anninos Loot eligible Space Groove View in 3D 1350 15.04.2021 It was pretty far out when Gwen applied to be Lux and Samira's quartermaster—after all, no one else did. Cheerfully sewing good vibes into great clothes, she amplifies disco energy through her nifty threads. Though she's new to this whole galactic hero gig, one thing's for sure: no way Gwen lets her friends liberate the galaxy in less-than-stellar outfits.

[2] She's the second heterochromic champion (first being Original Zoe ) with her right eye being teal, and the other being violet. Gwen will walk in her doll form for a short time if you let her transform during her joke animation. There is a Gwen easter egg within Ruined King: A League of Legends Story . Her dance is based on the PONPONPON music video. A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Thousand Cuts references the eponymous torture and execution method . Gwen's champion theme has elements of Viego's mixed in.
