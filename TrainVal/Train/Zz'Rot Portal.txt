Old icons 1st version Trivia Its deployment was planned for the first preseason patch V4.20 , but it was delayed due to reprioritizing other art assets. [1] [2] Raptor Cloak was actually made for this item and Ohmwrecker was tweaked to build from it later on. [3] Upon release, the Voidspawn were given huge damage whenever a player disconnected for longer than a minute (this causes their champion to gain 1000 armor and 1000 magic resistance ) Zz'Rot Portal was disabled until it could be fixed. [4] Voidspawn spawned from Void Gates are Voidborn . Upon the removal of Zz'Rot Portal in patch V9.23 , Gathering Swarm stacks for Malzahar's Void Swarm was renamed to Zz'Rot Swarm to honor the item. This might indirectly imply that Malzahar's voidlings are a similar if not the same species as the Voidspawn that spawned from this item. The Voidspawn was given a retexture and features as a monster in Invasion , a rotating game mode . In Teamfight Tactics , the Construct summoned from that game's version of the item reuses its icon, model and animations of the Voidspawn .
