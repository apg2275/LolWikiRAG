Not to be confused with the signal measured by latency. Pings are visual alerts used as a means of communication between players of a team during a match. Players can use these pings to provide tactical information about the state of the game to their team. These pings can be used anywhere on the map and at any time. Each ping has its own purpose during gameplay. Many of them are also transcribed in the team chat. Visual pings can be used on the ground of the map and on the mini-map itself and are displayed as such. No more than 6 pings can be used within a 5-second period. Doing so restricts further use of pings for 6/12/16/20/24 seconds, refreshing and increasing per ping cast after the lockout ensues, and attempting to use pings during this time sends a warning message in the chat. The warning reads: You must wait before issuing more pings.

Regular Pings [ ] There are 2 types of regular pings: Generic ( G + LMB / Hold Alt + LMB ) and Caution ( V + LMB / Hold Ctrl + LMB ). Both pings are used to gain a player's attention of an area or target. The Generic ping is a simple notification, whereas the Caution ping signals to be careful of potential danger. Generic Caution Generic (colorblind) Caution (colorblind) Pinging a target Regular pings can also be used on top of certain units to inform players to either target a unit (with Generic ) or avoid them (with Caution ). Using the Generic ping on an enemy champion , structure , or monster informs allies to target them. Using it on an allied structure signals a call for allies to defend it from enemy attackers. Using the Caution ping on an enemy champion , structure, or monster informs allies to avoid them. Using it on an allied champion signals them to retreat from their location, and using it on an allied structure signals to retreat from that structure and refrain from defending it. Target Defend Target (colorblind) Defend (colorblind) Smart Pings [ ] Smart pings are different from regular pings in that they allow for specific forms of communication between teammates. There are 8 types of smart pings: Retreat , Push , On My Way , All-In , Assist Me , Need Vision , Enemy Missing , and Enemy Vision . All of these pings provide for more established communication measures: Retreat : Withdraw from an unfavorable situation. Push : Clear out an enemy minion wave. On My Way : Ally is coming to the location they pinged. All-In : Engage and start a fight in the area. Assist Me : Help with a situation. Need Vision : Request to grant vision (place wards in the area). Enemy Missing : An enemy is missing in action. Enemy Vision : Opposing team has vision over the area. Retreat (formerly "Danger") Push On My Way All-In Assist Me Need Vision Enemy Missing Enemy Vision Retreat (colorblind) Push (colorblind) On My Way (colorblind) All-In (colorblind) Assist Me (colorblind) Need Vision (colorblind) Enemy Missing (colorblind) Enemy Vision (colorblind) Smart Pings Menu There is a user interface for smart pings that can be opened by holding down Alt / Ctrl / G / V + LMB . Pressing RMB closes the menu without issuing any pings. This menu displays all 8 smart pings on a wheel. Pings can be selected by dragging the mouse cursor in the designated direction of the desired ping on the wheel. Releasing the LMB button issues the ping at the location on the screen. Smart pings are located on this interface by the following: Caution (Center), Retreat (North), Assist Me (South), On My Way (East), Enemy Missing (West), Enemy Vision (Northwest), Push (Northeast), Need Vision (Southwest), and All-In (Southeast). Ping Behavior [ ] Using a ping causes it to be displayed on both the map and the mini-map at the same time, regardless of where the ping was issued. A ping on the ground (visible on the screen) lasts for 2 seconds, while a ping on the mini-map lasts 5 seconds (the icon persists for 2 seconds and the splashes for 5 seconds after pinging). The Need Vision ping leaves behind a small persistent indicator that lasts for 1 minute, or until a ward is placed nearby. Only one of these indicators may be active at a time per player, and using this ping again overrides the previous one. Allies' pings that are not directly visible on the player's camera will cause visual splashes and an indicator pointing in the ping's direction to appear at the edge of the screen. Enemy Missing pings will be displayed regardless of their location on the map, while Assist Me , Hold , On My Way , Retreat , and Caution pings will only be displayed if they were cast within 3000 units of your camera (and do not persist through panning away). Generic , Alert , and Enemy Missing pings may only be used 3 times each within 6 seconds at most. This incurs a separate cooldown from the global one, sending an alert to the player that reads: You must wait before issuing more pings of that type. Otherwise, the global ping cooldown is incurred as normal. Using a Generic or Vision ping near a ward within 10 seconds of an enemy placing it or an ally revealing it/attacking it, will cause an accurate ward timer for that ward to appear on the map. Normally, scoreboard pings on allies are only visible to the caster and their premade party (denoted by [Party] at the start). There are some exceptions to this behavior: If a summoner spell, item, or the ultimate ability cooldown is incurring the last half of its cooldown, pings on them will be visible to all allies. For 10 seconds after an ally scores a champion or epic monster takedown , all scoreboard pings on them will be visible to all allies. Ward timer (full) Chat Pings [ ] The allied team may also be notified of pings through chat. The only ping that is not transcribed is the Generic ping when cast on the map and without a target. Ping Transcriptions [ ] In addition to pings being displayed on the map and the mini-map, they are also transcribed to the team chat to notify players that somebody used a ping. Information of the ping is relayed to the chat. The player who used the ping will be indicated in the chat with [Summoner Name (Champion Name)] followed by the transcription of the ping. Note that Generic pings, when used on the ground, are not transcribed as they can represent any kind of communication. Regular pings have multiple transcriptions given that they can be used on units.
