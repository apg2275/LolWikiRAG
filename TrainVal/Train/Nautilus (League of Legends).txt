This effect cannot occur on the same target more than once every few seconds. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Physical Counters Spell shield Parries See Notes Missing Spell shield will block the root but not the bonus damage. Staggering Blow's enhanced attack can be blocked (the on-target cooldown will still be applied). The empowered attack will not trigger against structures . PENDING FOR TEST: : Staggering Blow's interactions with dodging and blinding effects. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit On-target cooldown changed to 5 seconds. Edit Dredge Line Dredge Line COST: 60 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 1122 WIDTH: 180 / 0 SPEED: 2000 Active: Nautilus hurls his anchor in the target direction that stops on the first enemy or terrain hit. If the anchor hits an enemy, it deals magic damage and reveals them, dragging them toward Nautilus while he also dashes toward them within 0. 9 seconds. Afterwards, the target is rooted for 0. 1 seconds. Magic Damage: 70 / 115 / 160 / 205 / 250 (+ 90% AP) If the anchor hits terrain, Nautilus dashes to that location and 50% of Dredge Line's cooldown and mana cost are refunded. Nautilus is unable to move or attack while Dredge Line is in flight. He can cast Titan's Wrath and Riptide during the dash. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded See Notes Blocked Disabled Knockdown Interrupted Dredge Line can interact with player-generated terrain . Nautilus will dash all the way to the target's location if Dredge Line executed them or they negated the displacement . Dredge Line will not interrupt any movement commands Nautilus was issued pre-cast so long as their directions somewhat correlate (this is intentional to smooth out traveling/escaping). Spell shield will block the ability but Nautilus will still dash partway to the target. The anchor projectile will stop if Nautilus dies while the projectile is traveling. Enemies hit will still be dealt damage. The drag and root are not applied if Nautilus did not initiate the dash. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.

Shield Strength: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+ 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12% maximum health) Pain of Wrath: The target takes magic damage over time, half dealt immediately and the other half dealt after 1. 25 seconds. Magic Damage: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 (+ 40% AP) Titan's Wrath resets Nautilus' basic attack timer. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries See Notes Missing Nautilus' empowered attacks use different attack animations. The damage over time will always apply when this animation plays (even if the shield fades during a basic attack). The Pain of Wrath damage over time debuff replaces itself when reapplied to the target, restarting its tick timer. This will prevent the second instance of damage from the previous debuff. The attacks do not deal the bonus damage against structures . PENDING FOR TEST: : Interaction with dodge , block and blind . Spell shield will block the ability (but only a single application). Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100. Damage AP ratio changed to 55% AP . Base shield changed to 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 / 160.

Edit Riptide Riptide COST: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 Mana COOLDOWN: 7 / 6. 5 / 6 / 5. 5 / 5 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 0 - 350 / 215 - 465 / 350 - 590 Active: Nautilus sends three waves of explosions that radiate from him over 0. 561 seconds . Each wave deals magic damage to enemies hit, reduced to 50% against those hit by subsequent waves beyond the first, and slows them by an amount that decays over 1. 5 seconds. Magic Damage: 55 / 90 / 125 / 160 / 195 (+ 50% AP) Reduced Damage: 27. 5 / 45 / 62. 5 / 80 / 97. 5 (+ 25% AP) Maximum Total Damage: 110 / 180 / 250 / 320 / 390 (+ 100% AP) Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Riptide deals 150% damage against monsters . Monster Damage: 82. 5 / 135 / 187. 5 / 240 / 292. 5 (+ 75% AP) Reduced Monster Damage: 41. 25 / 67. 5 / 93. 75 / 120 / 146. 25 (+ 37. 5 % AP) Maximum Total Monster Damage: 165 / 270 / 375 / 480 / 585 (+ 150% AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. The first wave is centered around Nautilus , while the second and third wave are centered at an offset of 25 units in front of Nautilus at the original cast location. Because of this, there are a zone each in which you can be hit by only 1 wave, or all 3 waves, respectively, without moving. The first wave happens at 0 seconds after the cast time ends, the second wave at 0. 297 seconds and the third wave at 0. 561 seconds. The intended timing may be 0. 25 seconds for each delay, however these are the measured, effective times. The explosions are only a visual effect. The first wave has 8, the seconds has 9, and the third wave has 10 explosions, equally distributed around the rings, starting with one explosion directly in Nautilus' facing direction on each. Edit Depth Charge Depth Charge COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 46 TARGET RANGE: 825 EFFECT RADIUS: 225 / 300 / 750 SPEED: 275 + 466. 67 per second Active: Nautilus sends out a Depth Charge that chases the target enemy champion , accelerating over time and creating eruptions every 0. 264 seconds in its wake that also briefly grant sight of the area. Enemies hit by the eruptions are dealt magic damage , knocked up for 1 second, and stunned for a duration. Magic Damage: 125 / 175 / 225 (+ 40% AP) Stun Duration: 1 / 1. 5 / 2 Upon reaching the primary target, the Depth Charge erupts a final time at their location. The primary target takes increased damage, is stunned for the same duration, and knocked up for a modified duration. Increased Damage: 150 / 275 / 400 (+ 80% AP) Knock Up Duration: 1 / 1. 5 / 2 Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Enemies a certain distance away from the charge / eruption are instead knocked back . Depth Charge's final eruption will occur prematurely if the primary target moves more than 3000 units away from it. Depth Charge will not stop chasing if the target dies or becomes untargetable. Dredge Line will not override Depth Charge's knock up . Nautilus will reveal himself during the cast time. Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Original View in 3D 880 14.02.2012 A lonely legend as old as the first piers sunk in Bilgewater, the armored goliath known as Nautilus roams the dark waters off the coast of the Blue Flame Isles. Driven by a forgotten betrayal, he strikes without warning, swinging his enormous anchor to save the wretched, and drag the greedy to their doom. It is said he comes for those who forget to pay the 'Bilgewater tithe', pulling them down beneath the waves with him—an iron-clad reminder that none can escape the depths.

A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. A tab for 'Urgot Mech' can be seen in Nautilus' ' Art Spotlight '. Nautilus has the longest basic attack animation in-game (which results in enemies being rooted by Staggering Blow when they visibly got out of range ). Nautilus was released without the ' Tank ' tag, though he actually is one. It was added shortly after. Nautilus does the Captain Morgan pose when standing idle for a long while. Nautilus comes from Greek word for sailor, ναυτίλος. Out of universe, Nautilus is also the name of a mollusc taxonomic family , the submarine from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne , and subsequently the first nuclear-powered submarine Nautilus and Ziggs were first conceived as ' Ivan the Mad Bomber'. During Nautilus' joke, when he is swimming in the air, he is humming a tune. This is the same tune that Squidward hums to himself in the shower during the Spongebob Movie. Nautilus is voiced by Richard Newman in Legends of Runeterra .
