If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Edit Hallucinate Hallucinate COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 100 / 90 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 250 Active: Shaco vanishes for 0. 5 seconds and blinks in the target direction while creating a clone of himself that is summoned in the opposite direction , remaining within control range of him as a controllable clone for up to 18 seconds. Hallucinate can be recast at any time while the clone is alive, and can be used while affected by cast-inhibiting crowd control . Recast: Shaco commands the clone to move to the target location.

The explosion and the boxes apply area damage , while the clone deals pet damage . Hallucinate will cast from wherever Shaco is at the end of the cast time. When Shaco dies, the clone will automatically target the closet visible enemy champion within 1500 units. The clone will always spawn in the opposite direction of the cursor. If Deceive and Hallucinate are used in quick succession, the clone will spawn in the direction of the cursor instead.

Spell effects Hallucination's basic attacks applies spell effects as pet damage , and area damage upon detonation. Protection Hallucination's attacks deal 60% damage to units (halved against structures) Spell shields will block Hallucination's detonation damage. Abilities Clone Hallucination is visually identical from Shaco to enemies (remains different to him and his allies). Mimic Hallucination can mimic the ability casts for Deceive , Jack in the Box and Two-Shiv Poison : When the clone blinks by any means, such as if it exits Shaco's leash range, it will play the ability's initial VFX of entering stealth without actually doing so. If the clone is within 300 units of Shaco when he casts Jack in the Box , it will play the ability's cast animation of placing the box. If the clone is within 575 units of Shaco's target for Two-Shiv Poison when the ability is cast, it will play the ability's cast animation of throwing the dagger in addition to firing a fake missile at the target. This missile has no effect on the target when it arrives. Seeing Double Hallucination benefits from Shaco's items but not from his runes . It does propagate its own auras (e.g. Immolate , Frozen Heart ). Immolate will not stack with Shaco's , unlike how other Immolates do. Shaco's buffs will be shown on the clone but won't work (i.e Crest of Cinders ). Surprise! Hallucination explodes upon expiring or dying, dealing magic damage to all enemies around it and dropping three mini-boxes around itself which activate instantly, causing nearby enemies to flee from them for 1 second.

Original View in 3D 790 09.10.2009 Crafted long ago as a plaything for a lonely prince, the enchanted marionette Shaco now delights in murder and mayhem. Corrupted by dark magic and the loss of his beloved charge, the once-kind puppet finds pleasure only in the misery of the poor souls he torments. He uses toys and simple tricks to deadly effect, finding the results of his bloody 'games' hilarious—and for those who hear a dark chuckle in the dead of night, the Demon Jester may have marked them as his next plaything. Adam Harrington Evan 'Somnicidal' Monteiro Loot eligible Mad Hatter View in 3D 520 08.06.2010 “It's always tea time,” said Shaco, cleaning his knife. “You can't drink tea without a nice, clean knife.” No one else responded, of course, because they were dead—which Shaco much preferred.

Adam Harrington Michal Ivan, Sixmorevodka Studio Highstakes Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Dark Star View in 3D 1350 13.06.2019 Shaco was once a region of space known for raucous celebration, wiped clean by the Dark Star and reborn into the mocking visage of a jester.

The eldritch corruption has stripped him of reason and identity, turning him into a chittering horde of knife-wielding monsters that haunt the boroughs of Valoran City. None of them are sure which is the “real” Shaco anymore. None of them care.

Now adorned in gold and ivory lace, Shaco claims to be making a statement about fast fashion and the constraints it puts on designers and models. Or maybe he just wants an excuse to show off his soul-power arms. Adam Harrington Jeremy Chong, West Studio Soul Fighter Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall This skin is a variant of Soul Fighter . Store variants are discounted for multiple purchases. Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] ERROR: Shaco's eyes are mistakenly colored purple on his uncentered splash art, Loading screen, Square, and Circle assets. They are supposed to be blue, as shown in his model, newest emotes, Illustration and Champie icons, centered splash art, and old splash art. Shaco is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin. When he uses Hallucinate , his clone will be of a different colour palette which can only be seen by Shaco and his allies. To the opposing team, the two Shacos look exactly the same, including copies of any external buffs and item effects active at the moment the clone is spawned (Prior to patch V5.22 , clones did not duplicate external buff/active item effect particles). Four other champions with this feature are LeBlanc (via Mirror Image ), Wukong's (via Warrior Trickster ), Nasus (via Fury of the Sands ) and Malphite (via Granite Shield and Thunderclap ). Shaco's dance references The Worm , a breakdance move . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Shaco might be referencing the Harlequin Crest from Diablo . It's possible that many aspects of Shaco's champion design, such as his appearance, his laugh and his "manic killer clown" persona were inspired by Kefka Palazzo from Final Fantasy VI . The name Shaco is an anagram for the word 'chaos' (mentioned in the Journal of Justice - Issue 13: 10 Questions with Shaco), befitting his penchant for it. There was a rework concept that turned Shaco into a projectile but hitting a Wind Wall in this form would remove him from the game.
