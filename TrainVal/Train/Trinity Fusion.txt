Trivia Trinity Force features the most champion statistics on one item. Spellblade's highest possible damage is 317 . This can be achieved by Mega Gnar , who has 158. 5 base attack damage at level 18. The name and icon of Trinity Force are inspired by The Legend of Zelda's Triforce . Trinity Force can be found by typing 'tons of damage' in the store 's search bar, which references David 'Phreak' Turley 's catchphrase in Champion Spotlights as well as the meme around it. The " Recommended Items " section of the store also displays " Tons of Damage " as the description for Trinity Force when shown as a recommended item for a champion. The swords in Trinity Force's current icon resemble Sheen with the two swords of Zeal (which used to be part of its build path). The three blades of Trinity Force represent the Land, Name, and Nation of Ionia . Its updated icon resembles Irelia's blades, which are fragments of an Ionian Crest. On June 12th, 2020, the Preseason 2021 Gameplay Plans [1] revealed a redrawn version of the item icon. The same icon was introduced in Wild Rift promotional videos and will be used in that game and possibly in League of Legends .
