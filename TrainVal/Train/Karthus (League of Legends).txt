If Defile has been learned, it will remain toggled on for Death Defied's entire duration. Requiem becomes disabled after Death Defied has lasted 4 seconds. While under this state, Karthus becomes untargetable and immune to crowd control as well as prevents all incoming damage, but is also rendered unable to move, declare basic attacks , use summoner spells , and activate items . Link ▶️ "I am become death!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Death Defied's untargetability does not destroy in-flight projectiles . Karthus cannot be executed by the Aspect of the Dragon during Death Defied . At the start of Death Defied , Karthus is set to 1 health . Karthus can still regenerate his health over the duration, but he will always die at the end of it. After Death Defied ends, the corpse of Karthus will retain unit collision despite being dead on the ground. Karthus' mana bar drains over the duration of Death Defied as an indicator of his time remaining in this state. Zombie states trigger upon taking lethal damage . Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering. All resurrection effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie. A champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect. Most buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state. Those that persist through death, such as Brand's Blaze , will remain. Undisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by Veigar's Event Horizon and Viktor's Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost. (bug) This does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state. (bug) Units within a zombie state cannot: Use Recall or Corrupting Potion / Refillable Potion . Activate resurrection effects. Take Dark Passage , Catapult , or gates . Pick up the Eye of the Herald . Be targeted by the following: Bailout Chronoshift Umbral Trespass . Be affected by the following: Curse of the Black Mist Fear Beyond Death's chain missile Test of Spirit's initial missile Lamb's Respite Realm of Death Fountain health restore Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit Duration changed to 5 seconds. Edit Lay Waste Lay Waste COST: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 Mana COOLDOWN: 1 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 875 EFFECT RADIUS: 160 Active: Karthus conjures a blast at the target location that detonates after 0. 528 seconds to 0. 759 seconds , granting sight of the area and dealing magic damage to all enemies within, doubled when only one target is struck. Magic Damage: 45 / 65 / 85 / 105 / 125 (+ 35% AP) Enhanced Damage: 90 / 130 / 170 / 210 / 250 (+ 70% AP) During Death Defied , Lay Waste will cast at maximum range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked The delay between the cast and the detonation is inconsistent, but always matches up with the VFX. (bug) Defile's ticks beyond the first has a similar issue. Applies spell damage if it hits a single target and area damage if it hits multiple targets. Lay Waste also plays a different sound effect when it only hits one target. Edit Wall of Pain Wall of Pain COST: 70 Mana COOLDOWN: 15 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1000 Active: Karthus erects a wall of pain at the target location perpendicular to his facing that lasts 5 seconds, granting sight around its pillars and center. Wall Length: 800 / 900 / 1000 / 1100 / 1200 Enemies that touch the wall are inflicted with 25% magic resistance reduction and become slowed for 5 seconds, decaying over the duration. This can affect enemies only once per cast. Slow: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% Reduced Slow: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Counters Spell shield Not Blocked No additional details. Edit Defile Defile COST: 30 / 42 / 54 / 66 / 78 Mana per second CAST TIME: none STATIC COOLDOWN: 0. 5 EFFECT RADIUS: 550 Passive: Karthus restores mana whenever he kills an enemy. Mana Restored: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 Toggle: Karthus surrounds himself in a necrotic aura that deals magic damage every 0. 25 seconds to all nearby enemies. Toggling Defile off triggers a final tick of damage. Magic Damage Per Tick: 7. 5 / 12. 5 / 17. 5 / 22. 5 / 27. 5 (+ 5% AP) Damage Per Second: 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 (+ 20% AP) Defile cannot be toggled off during Death Defied . Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Magic Counters Spell shield Not Blocked Toggle abilities do not count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Defile will restore mana if Karthus destroys an enemy structure. Defile re-calculates its damage with each tick based on changes in Karthus's ability power or an increase in the rank of Defile without the need to toggle it off and on again. Defile will toggle off automatically if Karthus enters resurrection . Edit Requiem Requiem COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 200 / 180 / 160 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: Global Active: Karthus channels for 3 seconds, then deals magic damage to all targetable enemy champions upon completion. Magic Damage: 200 / 350 / 500 (+ 75% AP) Link ▶️ "Die!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Invalid target override The ability will cast with no valid targets. Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Disruption Blocked Interrupted Due to several character stats needing to be recalculated each time a character spawns, casting Requiem immediately upon respawning will cause its cooldown to be unaffected by ability haste. Damage dealt is unaffected due to cast time. (bug) Requiem's channel is telegraphed to all enemy champions by a beam of light that descends on all targets, including if they are untargetable or even dead . Requiem will affect clones . The damage will apply spell effects to targets in an order based on proximity to Karthus . Single target spell effects (such as Luden's Companion ) are thus triggered on the closest enemy champion.

Karthus, the Deathsinger Karthus is voiced by Adam Harrington , who also voices Kassadin , Mordekaiser , Ryze, the Rogue Mage , and Shaco . During development he was called Lich . Requiem was likely named after Requiem Mass referencing Karthus' singing for/about the dead. His Chinese Classic splash art made a cameo in Fright Night along with Original Fiddlesticks . Karthus, the Deathsinger A glass case reading ' Press R to Win' can be seen in the game's Mac Version launch trailer. Before 2016, Karthus had been disabled for every single Ultra Rapid Fire edition (most likely to prevent 'Spam R to Win' abuse cases). For a brief time in Season Five , Karthus had a bug where he could remain in Death Defied indefinitely while alive and held an 87% win rate.
