After 8 seconds without dealing or taking damage, Tryndamere loses 5 Fury per second. Tryndamere gains 0% − 40% (based on Fury) critical strike chance . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Fury generation stacks additively: if the given action triggers multiple ways of generating Fury , all of them apply. Killing an enemy with a basic attack basic attack generates 15 Fury ( 5 Fury from the basic attack + 10 Fury from the kill). Killing an enemy with a critical strike generates 20 Fury ( 10 Fury from the critical strike + 10 Fury from the kill). The Fury gain for killing an enemy also stacks with Spinning Slash 's Fury generation per enemy hit. Attacks against structures will not grant bonus Fury , but will still reset the timer on Fury decay. Attacks against wards behave like attacks on normal enemies, generating 5 Fury and resetting the decay timer. Attacks against wards can critically strike , generating 10 Fury . Attacks against jungle plants will generate 5 Fury and reset the decay timer. Attacks can also critically strike , generating 10 Fury . Additionally, Honeyfruit drops restore 5 Fury for each pod collected and reset the decay timer. Attacking an Honeyfruit and collecting the pods generates 30 Fury , or 35 Fury if the plant was hit by a critical strike . Fury is only granted if the basic attack hits and will not be granted if Tryndamere cancels his basic attack windup. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Fury generation changed to 150%.

Bloodlust can be activated at any point of Tryndamere's basic attack . Note that if an basic attack will critically strike is determined when the basic attack starts. This means that if Bloodlust is cast during Tryndamere's basic attack windup, the attack will use the critical strike chance given by the Fury before the Bloodlust cast. Furthermore, the Fury for that basic attack will be given once the windup completes. This lets Tryndamere start building Fury immediately. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base heal changed to 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140. Heal AP ratio changed to 50% AP . Heal per 1 Fury changed to 1 / 1. 75 / 2. 5 / 3. 25 / 4.

Spinning Slash has no minimum dash range. Flash will interrupt the dash but Spinning Slash will deal damage to enemies at the new location instantly. Enemies already hit by Spinning Slash cannot be damaged more than once. To ensure Spinning Slash deals damage when dashing away from an enemy champion, Tryndamere needs to move r-35 units towards the enemy beyond the distance he can basic attack at, where r represents the enemy's radius and 35 is the distance in units beyond Tryndamere's basic attack range that Spinning Slash can reach.

Original View in 3D 585 30.04.2009 Fueled by unbridled fury and rage, Tryndamere once carved his way through the Freljord, openly challenging the greatest warriors of the north to prepare himself for even darker days ahead. The wrathful barbarian has long sought revenge for the annihilation of his clan, though more recently he has found companionship with Ashe, the Avarosan warmother, and a home with her people. His almost inhuman strength and fortitude is legendary, and has delivered him and his new allies countless victories against the greatest of odds. Brian Sommer Jason Chan Loot eligible Highland View in 3D 520 16.03.2010 Brian Sommer Unknown artist Legacy Loot eligible Legacy King View in 3D 520 21.09.2010 A proud king who was once known only as a brutal highland swordsman, Tryndamere rules his people as the martial protector of two great Freljordian houses. Yet every day he resists the pull of an intangible evil at his back, as he has not forgotten a certain blood debt that he vowed to see repaid. Brian Sommer Unknown artist Medieval Loot eligible Viking View in 3D 750 24.06.2011 Vikings believed that death in battle was a ticket to the eternal realm of Valhalla.

Brian Sommer Kienan 'Knockwurst' Lafferty Wonders of the World Loot eligible Legacy Demonblade View in 3D 1820 01.08.2011 Tryndamere's cursed blade corrupted him from a once honorable barbarian into a rampaging monster. Now in a frenzy to sate his endless hunger, this demonic sword drives him to slay all. With each kill another fraction of his humanity is lost and succumbing further into the demonic sword's madness. Brian Sommer Unknown artist Otherroads Loot eligible New voiceover New SFX/VFX Sultan View in 3D 975 26.09.2012 Tryndamere is a ruler from a distant land, and tales of his impossible strength and distinctive mustache have reached even the farthest-flung city-states. As is the rule rather than the exception with rulers from distant lands, his hat is exceptional. Brian Sommer Bo Lu Wonders of the World Loot eligible Warring Kingdoms View in 3D 975 28.01.2014 Tryndamere  is a grand general of the Warring Kingdoms, so deadly and so feared it is said he is the god of war incarnate. Truly a spectacle to behold, it would take a thousand men to kill him in battle, and a thousand more to keep him dead.

A single swing of his blade can cleave a beast's limb from its body, and he has the hunting trophies to prove it. Brian Sommer Victor '3rdColossus' Maury Prehistoric Hunters Loot eligible Chemtech View in 3D 975 05.06.2017 A monstrous experiment created by the villainous Singed, Tryndamere was irrevocably changed when he fell into a vat of volatile chemicals.
