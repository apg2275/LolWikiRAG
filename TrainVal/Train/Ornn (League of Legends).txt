Once Ornn selects an item to forge, he channels for 4 seconds, building the item and paying its gold cost upon completion. The channel is interrupted if Ornn takes damage from enemy champions or turrets . Living Forge is disabled for 4 seconds after starting the channel. Innate - Master Craftsman: Ornn uses his craftsmanship in forgery to upgrade certain Legendary items into Masterwork items, increasing their stats by roughly 1000 in gold value . When Ornn reaches level 13, the first eligible Legendary item in his inventory is upgraded automatically. For each level after 13 and before 18 (levels 14-17, total of 4), Ornn can upgrade one of an allied champion's eligible Legendary items into its Masterwork variant, once per ally. He can do so by selecting the ally while within 600 range, forging the item by performing Living Forge's channel. See details for a list of all eligible items. Additionally, Ornn increases his bonus armor , bonus magic resistance and bonus health by 10% from all sources, further increased by 4% each time he upgrades a Legendary item into a Masterwork item, for a total increase of 30% to each stat after the maximum of 5 upgrades. Innate - Temper: Ornn's basic attacks against Brittle enemies knock them back a short distance. Ornn's and allies' immobilizing effects against Brittle enemies will consume the debuff to deal bonus magic damage equal to 10% − 18% (based on Ornn's level) of the target's maximum health , capped at 250 against monsters , and cause the crowd control to last 30% longer (if applicable). Ornn will prioritize upgrading the first Legendary item eligible for a Masterwork upgrade based on its position in the inventory, detecting each slot until an eligible item is found.

Returning to base still brings health and mana items back to full. Ornn's basic attacks against Brittle enemies will end the duration of the debuff on-hit prematurely even if the knock back is not applied. His basic attacks against Brittle epic monsters will still render the debuff without the knock back being applied against them. Brittle's Tenacity reduction will benefit all applicable types of crowd control , not just immobilizes . The following do not consume Brittle but benefit from the reduction: blinds , cripples , disarms , grounding , silences , and slows . The bonus magic damage inflicted by Brittle is credited to Ornn , and benefits from his magic penetration . If an enemy champion has a Spell shield , Ornn's empowered attack against Brittle targets does not knock them back or deal the empowered damage, as they both get absorbed by the Spell shield . Masterwork items and their components are not the same item and so in theory any unnamed passives would stack and any unnamed actives would only put themselves on cooldown upon activated. This is however not true. Actives will always place their counterpart on cooldown. The following table refers for interactions while Ornn is channeling : All of Ornn's actions are disabled during the first 0. 5 seconds of the channel.

Ornn's Searing Charge and Call of the Forge God each apply both airborne and stun simultaneously for the same duration for this reason. Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit New Effect: Forging an item puts Living Forge on a 120-second cooldown. Arena differences edit Maximum Masterwork upgrades changed to 2 from 5. Stat increase per Mythic item forged changed to 6%. Automatic Masterwork upgrade changed to level 11. New Effect: Upon receiving the automatic upgrade, both his and his ally's Mythic items are upgraded to their Masterwork variants. New Effect: If he or his ally acquires the Mythical augment, the maximum number of Masterwork upgrades increases by 5.

Physical Damage: 20 / 45 / 70 / 95 / 120 (+ 110% AD) The fissure stops at maximum range or 200 units behind the first enemy champion struck. After 1. 125 -seconds, a magma pillar then erupts to knock aside enemies, though not through terrain, and linger as impassible terrain for 4 seconds. The pillar will not expire while Ornn is charging . Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked The fissure will move an 200 units beyond the first champion it hits, not exceeding the maximum range of the ability. It can still damage additional targets. If launched in a wall, pillar will try to appear on the other side of the wall, if it cannot the pillar will be destroyed. Spell shield will not prevent the knock aside from the magma pillar forming. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.

Over the march he belches fire over a cone in front of him, dealing magic damage every 0. 15 seconds to enemies hit. The final gout of flame will apply Brittle for 3 seconds.

For all associated collection items, see Ornn (Collection) . Original View in 3D 975 22.08.2017 Ornn is the Freljordian spirit of forging and craftsmanship. He works in the solitude of a massive smithy, hammered out from the lava caverns beneath the volcano Hearth-Home. There he stokes bubbling cauldrons of molten rock to purify ores and fashion items of unsurpassed quality. When other deities—especially Volibear—walk the earth and meddle in mortal affairs, Ornn arises to put these impetuous beings back in their place, either with his trusty hammer or the fiery power of the mountains themselves. Matthew Waterson Joshua 'HUGEnFAST' Brian Smith Loot eligible Thunder Lord View in 3D 1350 22.08.2017 In an age before man, King Ornn ruled the craggy southlands, and he was as rocky and lifeless as they were. It is said that he weathered an endless siege from his brother, the great King Voli, and that the blood they spilled sprouted grass and trees and animals, even as they became like beasts themselves. Matthew Waterson Mike Azevedo Thunder Lord Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Elderwood View in 3D 1350 10.12.2020 A truly ancient shaper of the Elderwood, and keeper of divine knowledge. Beings who tended the trees and directed the rivers are rare in this time of fell magic and endless twilight, yet Ornn continues on, stubbornly clinging to what remains of the old way.

But he's not a fan of the celebrity status it's earned him, hermiting himself away on a planet of whirling pools of goo to focus on his work. If Ornn is coming to party, it better be legendary.

A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. The language used in the musical accompaniment for The Path To Hearth-Home is described, in-universe, as "Ancient Freljordian". [2] It is based on Old Norse, and can be mostly understood by North Germanic speakers , like Icelanders, Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, etc. & to a lesser extent West Germanic speakers like English people, Germans, Netherlanders (Dutch people), etc. The singer is Nunu's mother Layka , voiced by Norwegian-Swedish composer Christine Hals , who has worked on Disney's cartoon Frozen soundtracks; [3] Ancient Freljordian is linguistically related to the Runeterran lingua franca (real-life English), due to in-universe cognates. Ornn is a pre-Freljordian theonym, with forgotten meaning; [4] Ornn resembles Old Norse verb *oʀna ᚢᛉᚾᚨ "to warm up" < Proto-Germanic *uznanan < PIE *Hus-n̥eh₂- . [5] The horned, caprinine appearance of Ornn's and his summoned element's may be referencing: Thor's goats Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr ; The horned Indo-European pastoral god(s). In-universe, Ornn names hammer after the verb; vice-versa in reality. The icon for Living Forge is reused for the Teamfight Tactics item Reforger .
