Innate: Whenever a nearby allied champion uses an ability to heal or shield either Nilah or themselves, both they and Nilah receive a bonus amount equal to 7. 5 % of the healing or 15% of the shielding after a 0. 5 -second delay. Bonus shielding lasts as long as the shield that triggered the effect, up to a maximum duration of 4 seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Nilah will gain a portion of all healing and all shielding from nearby allies that activate either of the effects on themselves while she is within range of them. The same applies to allies that grant Nilah a heal or shield; they gain a portion of the heal or shield given to her by them, even if the heal or shield affects both units. Heal and shields granted by items , runes , and summoner spells will not trigger the increased amount. The heal and shield increases do not trigger from their own heal or shield. Nilah may still gain a shield from her allies' shields even if they are longer than 4 seconds, but the buff of the shield will only last for up to 4 seconds. Nilah can receive a normal shield from nearby allies that gain physical or magic shields. The shield from Joy Unending is uncapped however runes like Overheal will limit the shield.

Formless Blade can hit structures and applies life steal at 100% effectiveness.

If Formless Blade hits an enemy, Nilah empowers herself for 4 seconds: gaining 125 bonus attack range and 10% − 50% (based on level) bonus attack speed , and causing her basic attacks to strike in a cone that deals 100% AD physical damage to enemies hit. Against secondary non-champion targets, this is reduced to 33% AD for minions and 10% AD for monsters , and additionally executes minions left below 20 health .

Having won her power through an encounter with the long-imprisoned demon of joy, she has no emotions other than unceasing jubilation—a small price to pay for the vast strength she now possesses.
