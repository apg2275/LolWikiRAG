Enemies struck are dealt magic damage and slowed by an amount that decays over 1. 5 seconds. The damage based on the target's health ratio is capped against minions and monsters . Magic Damage: 22 / 34 / 46 / 58 / 70 (+ 30% AP) (+ 3% (+ 0. 5 % per Feast stack) of target's maximum health) Total Magic Damage: 66 / 102 / 138 / 174 / 210 (+ 90% AP) (+ 9% (+ 1. 5 % per Feast stack) of target's maximum health) Capped Monster Percent Damage: 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% The width of the blast of spikes increases based on Cho'Gath's character size modifier when they launch, including but not limited to the bonus from Feast stacks .

Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked Bypass Blocked The missiles are launched from an offset 25 units in front of Cho'Gath and towards the target's location on-attack-complete. When attacking enemies within 25 units center-to-center of Cho'Gath , the missile will fire in the opposite direction. Cho'Gath's size factors into the wideness of the hitbox Vorpal Spikes has. External size modifiers ( Wild Growth ) contribute to this. At certain size thresholds, the missile gets replaced by a different one with a different width. At each step, the width grows by 30, except for the 3rd missile, where it only grows by 10. (bug) Some of the size thresholds are placed very weird. (bug) The missile range is unchanged. The empowered attack will trigger but not apply its effects against structures . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 32 / 44 / 56 / 68 / 80.

Only 6 stacks can be gained from non-epic monsters or minions . Each stack of Feast increases the cast range of the ability by 2. 5 , for a maximum increase of 25 at 10 stacks, and grants Cho'Gath bonus health as well as bonus attack range and increased size , capping at 75 bonus attack range and 100% increased size. Bonus Health Per Stack: 80 / 120 / 160 Bonus Attack Range Per Stack: 4. 7 / 6. 2 / 7. 7 Bonus Size Per Stack: 6 / 8 / 10% Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage True Drawn Counters Spell shield Blocked The increased size stacks additively with other size increases.

The bonus attack range and increase size cap at respectively 16. 25 / 12. 19 / 9. 75 and 16. 67 / 12. 5 / 10 stacks, with the last stack being effective as the decimal part of the value (no decimal meaning 100% as effective). Each stack of Feast increases the damage by 8 / 12 / 16. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Original View in 3D 585 25.06.2009 From the moment Cho’Gath first emerged into the harsh light of Runeterra’s sun, the beast was driven by the most pure and insatiable hunger. A perfect expression of the Void’s desire to consume all life, Cho’Gath’s complex biology quickly converts matter into new bodily growth—increasing its muscle mass and density, or hardening its outer carapace like organic diamond. When growing larger does not suit the Void-spawn’s needs, it vomits out the excess material as razor-sharp spines, leaving prey skewered and ready to feast upon later.

There, he offers scones and jam, with a spot of tea… so his guests may savor their last meal before becoming one themselves. Unknown voice actor Unknown artist High Society Loot eligible New voiceover New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Loch Ness View in 3D 520 01.03.2011 Citing nothing more than a blurry photograph, the locals in one isolated town insist on the existence of a large, predatory marine animal that grows in size every time it feeds. The reports are otherwise unsubstantiated, but the spike in tourism has been great for the local economy. Not the disappearances, though. Those are bad.

It has become a common and terrifying sight in occupied cities, where it feeds on civilians who won't submit to conversion. J.S.

Seeing as there are no sane hunters, Cho'Gath enjoys a steady supply of lightly armored food. Unknown voice actor Michal Ivan, Sixmorevodka Studio Prehistoric Hunters Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Dark Star View in 3D Special 13.07.2018 Spawned from the remnants of a star system crippled by famine, Cho'Gath is driven to feed on any celestial body that crosses his path.

Empowered by sacred artifacts from the congregation's crypts, it has remained dormant while Nocturne feeds it prisoners to build its power. Despite its maker's intentions, nothing will be able to sate the monster's hunger once it fully awakens.

Cho'Gath was the first champion to receive a second Legendary skin (though Corki has two 1820 skins both of which are Legacy and Tristana has also two 1820 skins although one is Legacy and the other one is available). Cho'Gath's dance references Fantasmic! by Mickey Mouse . Riot created an Adobe Flash minigame dedicated for him called Cho'Gath Eats the World for April Fools' Day 2013 . Another minigame released on the same date, Astro Teemo , which was unlocked by playing to a certain point in this game. The depiction of Cho'Gath in the icon of Feral Scream was based on his pose in his Original splash art . In the now-removed official League of Legends forums , the original icon of Feral Scream was used to represent the "General Discussion" section. In the official League of Legends game trailer from 2009, Cho'Gath was given generic T-Rex sounds. In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch; The following changes regarding Cho'Gath were jokingly listed： Cho'Gath now starts the game the same size as if he had 6 feasts . Feast still increases Cho'Gath's size. Bushes can no longer stealth Cho'Gath. The following joke item was listed to be added: NEW Yordle Saddle: Any yordle champion can buy this new item to ride Cho'Gath. Cho'Gath was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Big Stompy Monster" (along with its huge variant) in Invasion , a featured game mode .
