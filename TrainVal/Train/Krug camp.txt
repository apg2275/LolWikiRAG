Strategy [ ] Unlike other camps, the counter-jungling strategy on the Krug camp is to kill the Ancient Krug and the units it splits into while leaving behind the Krug from the original camp. Note that if it's not possible to kill every unit the Ancient Krug splits into, the camp can be left nonetheless. The additional units spawned will despawn after being out-of-combat for a short period of time, denying experience from the enemy jungler. When taking Krugs , you first want to hit the Krug so it comes close to you and then move to one of its side while having the Ancient Krug on the opposite side. thus preventing the Ancient Krug from attacking you. This is because the larger Ancient Krug does much more damage than the smaller Krugs . Trivia [ ] The Krug camp is a replacement for the Golem camp on Summoner's Rift since patch V4.20 . Veteran players still sometimes refer to the Krugs as Golems . Ancient Krug replaced the Big Golem . Krug replaced the Golem .
