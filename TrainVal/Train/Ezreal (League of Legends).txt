His courage and bravado knowing no bounds, he prefers to improvise his way out of any situation, relying partially on his wits, but mostly on his mystical Shuriman gauntlet, which he uses to unleash devastating arcane blasts.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Ezreal was the first to have a ' Champion Spotlight '. He is one of few to feature in multiple ones due to significant gameplay changes (the others being Lee Sin , Karma , Katarina , and Sivir ). He was also the first 6300 champion released after the game's official launch on 27-Oct-2009. He was named after Colt 'Ezreal' Hallam . His dance both before and after his visual update references the dance from the ' Hare Hare Yukai ' ED of the The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime. According to a forum post by Colt 'Ezreal' Hallam, the idea for him to have this dance came from Miyuki 'Shurelia' Mitsuhashi . [2] A side-by-side comparison from before his update can be seen here . A side-by-side comparison from after his update can be seen here . Much like Akali's Visual Gameplay Update, Ezreal's previous iteration is still considered canon. [3] [4] Ezreal is the first champion to have 13 skins and one of the first to have 12 skins. He and Miss Fortune attained their twelfth skin at the same time with the Pajama Guardian skin set. Ezreal is the first champion to have a skillshot ability that can give buffs to allies with his Essence Flux , but it was reworked from V8.20 . Ezreal is also the first champion to have a skillshot ability that can heal to allies with his Essence Flux , but its heal component was removed from V1.0.0.94 . There is a Runescape NPC based on and named after Ezreal.
