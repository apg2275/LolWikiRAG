The total damage is increased by 0% − 150% (based on distance traveled) . Minimum Magic Damage: 7 − 50 (based on level) (+ 50 / 80 / 110 / 140 / 170) (+ 60% AP) Maximum Magic Damage: 17. 5 − 125 (based on level) (+ 125 / 200 / 275 / 350 / 425) (+ 150% AP) The star lingers at maximum range for 1 second, during which Paddle Star can be recast after 0. 25 seconds in the duration. Recast: Zoe redirects the star in the target path, empowering it with increased speed and radius, and resetting its damage modifier on cast. The redirected star can travel until it reaches 800-units outbound from Zoe . Paddle Star's recast can be used while affected by cast-inhibiting crowd control . Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Both casts count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as More Sparkles! , Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. The recast radius matches the initial cast radius of the ability, but Zoe can move any amount of distance away from the projectile before reactivating. Paddle Star's effect radius is centered around the location of the missile as it collides. Paddle Star plays new SFX while an enemy is affected by Sleepy Trouble Bubble . Edit Spell Thief Spell Thief COST: 1 Spell Shard COOLDOWN: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 2200 / Global / 1500 / 525 Passive - Wheeeee: Whenever Zoe casts Spell Thief or a summoner spell, she gains bonus movement speed for a duration, and summons three bolts that orbit her for the next 10 seconds. Bonus Movement Speed: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70% Bonus Movement Speed Duration: 2 / 2. 25 / 2. 5 / 2. 75 / 3 If Zoe is not affected by complete crowd control , she shoots one bolt at a time at the nearest non- sleeping enemy in range, prioritizing her attack target, dealing magic damage with each bolt. Magic Damage Per Bolt: 25 / 35 / 45 / 55 / 65 (+ 13. 3 % AP) Total Magic Damage: 75 / 105 / 135 / 165 / 195 (+ 40% AP) Passive: Whenever an enemy champion casts a summoner spell or item active , they drop the corresponding Spell Shard onto the ground that grants sight over a 100-radius area and remains for 40 seconds. Enemy minions have a 10% chance to spawn with a random Spell Shard that drops and remains for 20 seconds if Zoe kills them. Allied champions that kill them will cause the orb to drop only if Zoe is nearby. Zoe can collect a Spell Shard for 60 seconds, and replace it by moving directly onto another Spell Shard . Active: Zoe mimics the active of the collected Spell Shard . Link ▶️ "You left a copy of your spell here. I took it. 'Kay thanks."

Zoe will cast Spell Thief in place of her own summoner spells if she has either of them as a collected Spell Shard , even if she tries to cast the summoner spell while it is on cooldown. Minions that can drop Spell Shards are marked with a tied cosmic balloon that floats above them. Minions do not drop a shard for Teleport . Zoe utilizes an attack-like animation whenever one of the bubbles hurls itself at an enemy, making it look as if she can attack while moving. Zoe cannot steal consumables , trinkets , component items, or items that create deployable or persistent effects. Some actives are excluded.

Edit Sleepy Trouble Bubble Sleepy Trouble Bubble COST: 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 800 + 50 + 250 EFFECT RADIUS: 250 WIDTH: 100 / 200 SPEED: 1850 Active: Zoe kicks a bubble in the target direction that bursts upon the first enemy hit, otherwise lingering at maximum range over 1 second, then becoming a trap for 5 seconds that bursts upon contact with an enemy. The bubble can move through terrain only once, but travels the entire distance as bonus range, and will fall short if it would enter terrain again. The burst deals magic damage to the target and inflicts them with drowsy for 1. 4 seconds, which gradually slows them until they fall asleep for 2. 25 seconds. While the target is asleep , they are inflicted with 30% magic resistance reduction . Magic Damage: 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+ 45% AP) Maximum Slow: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30% The next instance of non- persistent damage that the sleeping target takes from champions , large monsters or structures consumes the debuff to deal bonus true damage equal to the post-mitigation damage dealt, capped at Sleepy Trouble Bubble's damage. The bonus damage is dealt before the triggering damage. Bonus Damage Cap: 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+ 45% AP) Maximum Mixed Damage: 140 / 220 / 300 / 380 / 460 (+ 90% AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Zoe will gain obscured vision of the target while they're asleep if they are not visible . If exceptionally close to terrain, the bubble will pass through without detection and will still be able to pass through a second piece of terrain - although it sacrifices any range its already used going through the first piece. Sleepy Trouble Bubble can interact with player-generated terrain . Sleepy Trouble Bubble's range will be extended if Zoe casts it right before blinking back from Portal Jump . This is due to the range of the missile being measured at the start of the cast time and Zoe already having blinked back once the cast time finishes. At the end of the path of the initial missile, before continuing with the short bounce, Sleepy Trouble Bubble checks for targets in a 100 radius to immediately collide with. This "lollipop" is one of only a few that is larger than the ability's missile width. Sleepy Trouble Bubble can still be collided with during the short bounce between end of initial missile and the trap being formed. This seems to use a very small or negative collision radius, rather than normal missile collision. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

She will still be considered to blink even if she fails to move her intended location while attached (e.g. if she were affected by The Show Stopper ). Zoe can attack and cast abilities and movement spells at the target location for 0. 5 seconds after she is able to use them again. Upon reaching her destination, Zoe will either raspberry at the nearest enemy champion, or lick an ice cream cone when there are no enemy champions in sight .

For all associated collection items, see Zoe (Collection) . Original View in 3D 975 21.11.2017 As the embodiment of mischief, imagination, and change, Zoe acts as the cosmic messenger of Targon, heralding major events that reshape worlds. Her mere presence warps the arcane mathematics governing realities, sometimes causing cataclysms without conscious effort or malice. This perhaps explains the breezy nonchalance with which Zoe approaches her duties, giving her plenty of time to focus on playing games, tricking mortals, or otherwise amusing herself. An encounter with Zoe can be joyous and life affirming, but it is always more than it appears and often extremely dangerous.

Polaris considered the three leaders' wishes, and with a wave of her hand, conjured the Aurora into two shapes: a sinewy mass of teeth and fur, and a tireless, smiling soldier.

This trait is preserved in all of her skins. In Ancient Greek , Zoe Ζωή ( IPA : [zdɔː.ɛ̌ː] > [zo'i]) means "life", as opposed to "death"; [2] while its cognate βῐ́ο(το)ς bio(to)s means "lifetime" or "the living's world". [3] Upon jumping out of Portal Jump's second portal, Zoe licks the ice cream cone, which she attempts to eat during her joke animation (Ctrl+1). Zoe has multiple walk cycles that change randomly over the course of the game, but players can also toggle the next one using the Toggle key bind (default [Ctrl] + [5]). During her champion sneak peek video, AstroNautilus and Astronaut Teemo make cameos: AstroNautilus appears when Zoe is showing some of her dance moves. Astronaut Teemo shows up when Zoe falls through a portal and Cyber Pop Zoe comes out of it. At the end of her sneak peek video, Zoe is listening to Kinetic (The Crystal Method x Dada Life) , one of DJ Sona's music tracks. Her title, as found on the store, "Zoe, The Aspect of Twilight" is one of the few occurrences, along with Kayn , Taliyah , Aurelion Sol , Illaoi , Elise , Sion , of having the word "the" capitalized, compared to all other champions' titles. Zoe has a cameo in the action role-playing game, CrossCode . [4] Zoe's Series 1 Eternals make the following references: Finders Keepers references the idiom finders keepers, losers weepers . Paddle Ball Champion references the sport of paddle ball and its similarites to Paddle Star .
