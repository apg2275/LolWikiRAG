Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive The movement speed from Serpentine Grace is worth 48 per level, up to a maximum of 864 at level 18. Without other movement speed modifiers taken into account, Serpentine Grace grants Cassiopeia a total of 332 − 400 (based on level) movement speed . As Predator and Magical Footwear require boots, they will be replaced with Electrocute and Triple Tonic , respectively. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit New Effect: Increases the Guardian item limit to 2. Bonus movement speed changed to 2. 8 − 50. 4 (based on level) . Edit Noxious Blast Noxious Blast COST: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 mana COOLDOWN: 3. 5 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 850 EFFECT RADIUS: 200 Active: Cassiopeia creates a blast at the target location that explodes after a 0. 4 -second delay. Enemies within the blast are poisoned for 3 seconds, taking magic damage every 0. 429 seconds over the duration. Total Magic Damage: 75 / 110 / 145 / 180 / 215 (+ 90% AP) Magic Damage Per Tick: 10. 71 / 15. 71 / 20. 71 / 25. 71 / 30. 71 (+ 12. 86 % AP) If Noxious Blast hits an enemy champion , Cassiopeia gains bonus movement speed that decays over 3 seconds. Bonus Movement Speed: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Noxious Blast always uses quick cast , regardless of player settings. The damage inflicted by Noxious Blast is calculated as follows: damage / 7 ticks rounded down to the nearest integer. For example: with 0 bonus AP Noxious Blast inflicts 75 damages over 7 ticks of damage, so 75/7 (≈10.71) deals first of all 10 damage, then (2 × 75/7)  −  10 (≈11.43) deals in a second time 11 damages, then (3 × 75/7)  −  10  −  11 (≈11.14) deals in a third time 11 damages, and so on. The damage displayed for Noxious Blast DOT ( Damage_over_time ) always remains constant and corresponds to the previously mentioned formula: damage / 7 ticks rounded down to the nearest integer. It's important not to confuse the consistent displayed damage with the actual damage, which is updated with each tick, see tick and updates . With the same example as above, the damage displayed is always 10. Occasionally, Noxious Blast may not deal the displayed damage. This discrepancy occurs when the calculated damage falls between 0.5 and 1. In such cases, rounding to the nearest integer, specifically rounding up, creates a 1-point difference. It's important to note that the damage is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example: with a Blasting Wand's , Noxious Blast shows  so rounded to the nearest integer 116 magic damage, but really deals using the formula above 115 magic damage. (bug) When Cassiopeia has precisely 20 bonus AP or 40 bonus AP . In this scenario, Noxious Blast may inflict 1 less damage than intended. Importantly, this bug occurs independently of rounding considerations. PENDING FOR TEST: Enemies within the blast of Noxious Blast are poisoned for something between 3. 2 and 3. 3 seconds.

Enemies within the clouds are poisoned to take magic damage every 0. 263 seconds and become grounded and slowed by an amount that decays over the area's duration. Magic Damage Per Second: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+ 15% AP) Total Magic Damage: 100 / 125 / 150 / 175 / 200 (+ 75% AP) Slow: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% Miasma will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Not Blocked Blocked Cleanses are ineffective against Miasma since the area of effect constantly reapplies the effect. If a target becomes untargetable while affected by the ground , the debuff will refresh to 0. 25 seconds. Wind Wall will block the portion of Miasma it destroys. Miasma inflicts 5 / 6. 25 / 7. 5 / 8. 75 / 10 (+ 3,75% AP) magic damage per tick, and in fact because there is 19 ticks and not 20 ticks, the total magic damage is currently not 100 / 125 / 150 / 175 / 200 (+ 75% AP) but 95 / 118. 75 / 142. 5 / 166. 25 / 190 (+ 71,25% AP) . (bug) Sometimes Miasma randomly inflicts only 18 ticks of damage. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 28 / 26 / 24 / 22 / 20 seconds. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Cassiopeia_WVideo.ogv Edit Twin Fang Twin Fang COST: 50 / 48 / 46 / 44 / 42 mana COOLDOWN: 0. 75 CAST TIME: 0. 125 TARGET RANGE: 700 SPEED: 2500 Active: Cassiopeia launches her fangs at the target enemy that deal 52 − 120 (based on level) (+ 10% AP) magic damage . If this kills the target, Twin Fang's mana cost is refunded. Against a poisoned target, Twin Fang deals bonus magic damage and heals Cassiopeia . The heal is reduced by 75% against minions and small and medium monsters . Bonus Magic Damage: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+ 60% AP) Total Enhanced Damage: 52 − 120 (based on level) (+ 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100) (+ 70% AP) Heal: 10 / 11. 5 / 13 / 14. 5 / 16% AP Reduced Heal: 2. 5 / 2. 875 / 3. 25 / 3. 625 / 4% AP Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Upon reaching the target, Twin Fang will wait for an ongoing Noxious Blast to explode before dealing its damage. Twin Fang's damage against poisoned targets: When maxed first: 72 − 220 (based on level) (+ 70% AP) . When maxed second: 72 − 220 (based on level) (+ 70% AP) . When maxed last: 72 − 220 (based on level) (+ 70% AP) . Twin Fang's cast indicator is incorrectly adding her own radius to the range like an edge range ability, and therefore slightly larger than the actual cast range Twin Fang can cast at. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Poisoned AP ratio changed to 45% AP . Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Cassiopeia_EVideo.ogv Edit Petrifying Gaze Petrifying Gaze COST: 100 mana COOLDOWN: 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 5 EFFECT RADIUS: 850 ANGLE: 80° Active: Cassiopeia blasts enemies in a cone in the target direction, dealing magic damage to enemies struck within and slowing them by 40% for 2 seconds. Enemies with their facing direction towards her are instead stunned for the same duration. Magic Damage: 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 50% AP) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Cassiopeia will turn to face the target direction over the cast time. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Petrifying Gaze's target direction will change if Cassiopeia's facing direction changes during the cast time (i.e. through knockbacks ). The facing direction of champions whose abilities/animations cause them to lock their facing or spin is always the direction they are moving in. For abilities that cause the champion to spin in place (e.g. Death Lotus , Judgment ) it will factor the direction they were facing on cast. Lucian's The Culling is an exception and his facing direction is actually considered to be the direction he is facing. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 100 / 175 / 250. AP ratio changed to 40% AP .

For all associated collection items, see Cassiopeia (Collection) . Original View in 3D 880 14.12.2010 Cassiopeia is a deadly creature bent on manipulating others to her sinister will. Youngest and most beautiful daughter of the noble Du Couteau family of Noxus, she ventured deep into the crypts beneath Shurima in search of ancient power. There, she was bitten by a gruesome tomb guardian, whose venom transformed her into a viper-like predator. Cunning and agile, Cassiopeia now slithers under the veil of night, petrifying her enemies with her baleful gaze. Karen Strassman Evan 'Somnicidal' Monteiro Loot eligible Chromas Original Cassiopeia Chromas Day Dusk Night Desperada View in 3D 520 14.12.2010 Enterprising creatures of the Old West often fall in with more successful bandit clans, serving as nightmarish enforcers, unafraid of a little casual violence. Cassiopeia became infamous as one such outlaw, but following a bloody coup now leads an enclave of her own. Karen Strassman Unknown artist High Noon Loot eligible Siren View in 3D 520 14.12.2010 A humanoid marine serpent known for luring sailors to their deaths, Cassiopeia has a bad reputation and wants to set the record straight.

Karen Strassman Unknown artist Fables Loot eligible Mythic View in 3D 975 18.07.2012 On a cliff overlooking the sea, the lonely gorgon Cassiopeia has made her home among a garden of statues of her own making. Memories of friends, enemies, and lovers passed, immortalized in stone, many eternally screaming in agony. Whispers from the local villages warn not to enter her domain, but still, visitors keep coming, all to meet the same fate. Karen Strassman Unknown artist Fables Loot eligible Jade Fang View in 3D 975 08.02.2013 An adherent to the teachings of the legendary jade dragon, Cassiopeia keeps its archaic rituals secret and the beast's true nature shrouded in mystery.

Karen Strassman Silvia Meiliani, Caravan Studio Bewitching Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Bewitching Cassiopeia Chromas Citrine Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Turquoise Patch history For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia Cassiopeia was the last champion released in 2010 as well as the third one to feature an ' Art Spotlight ' (hers in particular shows how her taunt was animated). Cassiopeia's basic attack particles were snakes at release, as seen in her Champion Spotlight . Cassiopeia - Katarina is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being Kayle - Morgana , Garen - Lux , Nasus - Renekton , Yasuo - Yone , Darius - Draven , and Vi - Jinx ). Though not a pair, Anivia , Ornn , and Volibear are also siblings. Twin Fang directly benefits from allied poison abilities in the same fashion Last Breath does with displacement ones. Her name's first element derives from Hebrew קְצִיעָה‏ qeṣiah cassia : Possibly from Semitic root K-S "cut", as the barks were scrapped from the tree's trunk; Or borrowed from Old Chinese 桂 *kʷeːs (> Mandarin guì /kʷei̯˥˩/) " osmanthus fragrans ", by spice-merchants who imported the barks; the suffix -opeia is etymologically uncertain. The inspiration for Cassiopeia comes from mainly three sources: Greek mythology She shares names with the eponymous constellation charted by Ptolemy as well as the eponymous queen from Greek Mythology . Miasma references the eponymous mythical disease . She resembles a Gorgon (with Petrifying Gaze and her death animation referencing Medusa ) as well as a Drakaina . Hellenised Ptolemaic Egypt Her seductress background references Cleopatra VII . Hers is the the Belly Dance. Indian Nāgini .
