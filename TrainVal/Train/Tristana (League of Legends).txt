Edit Rapid Fire Rapid Fire COOLDOWN : 20 / 19 / 18 / 17 / 16 CAST TIME: none Active: Tristana empowers her cannon, gaining bonus attack speed for 7 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 65 / 80 / 95 / 110 / 125% Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Rapid Fire is a non-refreshing buff that will not update on rank-up. Edit Rocket Jump Rocket Jump COST: 60 mana COOLDOWN: 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 900 EFFECT RADIUS: 350 SPEED: 1100 Active: Tristana jumps to the target location. Upon landing, she deals magic damage to nearby enemies and slows them by 60% for a duration. Magic Damage: 95 / 145 / 195 / 245 / 295 (+ 50% AP) Slow Duration: 1 / 1. 5 / 2 / 2. 5 / 3 Scoring an enemy champion takedown or detonating Explosive Charge at maximum stacks on a champion will reset Rocket Jump's cooldown . Tristana can cast any of her abilities during the dash. Rocket Jump will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Tristana can still use her abilities , summoner spells , and item actives during Rocket Jump . Rocket Jump's dash speed depends on the distance of the jump. Close-ranged jumps are much shorter while long-ranged jumps leave Tristana in the air significantly longer. If Tristana has less than 850 movement speed, a full-range Rocket Jump (including its cast time) will make her arrive quicker at its destination than walking at this speed could. Killing clones or detonating Explosive Charge on them also resets Rocket Jump's cooldown. The former may be unintended. Edit Explosive Charge Explosive Charge COST: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana COOLDOWN: 16 / 15. 5 / 15 / 14. 5 / 14 CAST TIME: 0. 226 (at base attack speed) TARGET RANGE: 525 − 661 (based on level) EFFECT RADIUS: 300 / 300 / 600 SPEED: 2400 Passive: Tristana's basic attacks are empowered to trigger an explosion when they kill the target, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies. Magic Damage: 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 (+ 25% AP) Active: Tristana tosses an explosive charge at the target enemy that attaches to them for 4 seconds. The charge then detonates, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies. Explosive Charge can target and damage turrets , and explodes in a larger radius on a turret. Minimum Physical Damage: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 (+ 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150% bonus AD) (+ 50% AP) Tristana's basic attacks on-hit and abilities against the target increase Explosive Charge's damage by 30%, stacking up to 4 times for a maximum 120% increase, upon which the charge also detonates instantly. The charge's total damage is additionally increased by 0% − 33. 3 % (based on critical strike chance) . Bonus Damage Per Stack: 21 / 24 / 27 / 30 / 33 (+ 15 / 22. 5 / 30 / 37. 5 / 45% bonus AD) (+ 15% AP) Maximum Physical Damage: 205 / 235 / 264 / 293 / 323 (+ 146. 6 / 219. 9 / 293. 3 / 366. 6 / 439. 9 % bonus AD) (+ 146. 6 % AP) If Buster Shot is used to apply the last stack, the detonation will instead be delayed until the end of the knock back or the 4 seconds expire. Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Area damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Blocked See Notes Blocked Explosive Charge's cast time is always 100% of the caster's attack windup time. At base attack speed, Tristana's attack windup is 0. 225625 seconds. An easy formula to calculate the cast time is [ 0. 14801 seconds divided by total attack speed ]. Reducing Tristana's attack speed via attack speed reductions also increases Explosive Charge's cast time by the same fraction. It is calculated from Tristana's total attack speed after cap (2.5) and floor (0.2), making the maximum possible cast time 0. 759 seconds . Tristana will be automatically ordered to basic attack the target after the cast time. Explosive Charge's initial application deals 0 physical damage , triggering turret aggro. It also triggers a stack of effects such as Electrocute . All explosions by Explosive Charge's passive count as the same cast instance. Every cast of the active is a separate cast instance: Hitting a champion with the passive by killing a nearby unit, casting the active on them (see note above) and landing a basic attack against them triggers Electrocute . Hitting a champion with the passive by killing a nearby unit, casting the active on them and hitting them again with the Passive by killing another nearby unit does not trigger Electrocute . Dodge , block and blind all prevent Explosive Charge's stack application via basic attacks. Explosive Charge's detonation will deal damage to the primary target even if they have become untargetable . Explosive Charge's stacks from basic attacks are applied as an on-hit effect and will therefore interact with Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit and Runaan's Hurricane's bolts. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Edit Buster Shot Buster Shot COST: 100 mana COOLDOWN: 120 / 110 / 100 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 525 − 661 (based on level) EFFECT RADIUS: 200 SPEED: 2000 / 1500 Active: Tristana fires a massive cannonball at the target enemy that deals magic damage . They and surrounding enemies are also knocked back and stunned for up-to 0. 75 seconds , during which they are revealed . Magic Damage: 300 / 400 / 500 (+ 100% AP) Knock Back Distance: 600 / 800 / 1000 Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro See Notes Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Applies spell damage to the primary target and deals 0 default damage to secondary targets. The 0 damage to secondary targets triggers turret aggro, but does not stack Explosive Charge . Tristana will attempt to basic attack the target afterwards. Buster Shot's displacement direction is based on Tristana's location at the end of the cast time. The primary target is pushed in a straight line away from that location, but the knockback distance and speed may be impeded by terrain. Secondary targets are displaced parallel to the primary target's displacement. The crowd control is removed early when the forced movement stops. At normal knockback distance and knockback speed, this changes the duration of the disable to circa 0. 4 / 0. 5 / 0. 6 seconds by default. Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Original View in 3D 585 21.02.2009 While many other yordles channel their energy into discovery, invention, or just plain mischief-making, Tristana was always inspired by the adventures of great warriors. She had heard much about Runeterra, its factions, and its wars, and believed her kind could become worthy of legend too. Setting foot in the world for the first time, she took up her trusty cannon Boomer, and now leaps into battle with steadfast courage and optimism. Elspeth Eastman Unknown artist Loot eligible Riot Girl View in 3D Special 15.12.2009 Despite the RPD's best efforts to curb Tristana's enthusiasm for vigilante justice, they haven't been successful. Then again, with a combination of determination, moxy, and explosives, she's more than capable of evading The Man. Whenever Tristana is "off-duty," she can be found at a punk show or passing out the newest edition of her zine, "Riot Riot! Elspeth Eastman Jean 'Curing' Go Riot Loot inelgible Earnest Elf View in 3D 520 31.12.2009 Known for her warm smile and heartfelt sincerity, Tristana's love of holiday cheer brings joy to everyone.

Elspeth Eastman Unknown artist Snowdown Showdown Loot eligible Legacy Firefighter View in 3D 1820 03.06.2010 Recently featured on this year's “most Yordle-y firefighters” calendar, Tristana will gladly leap into the flames regardless of whether anyone is supporting her. Often she'll go despite her support. Firefighter support. She fights fires. Elspeth Eastman Shuohan Zhou Day Job Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Guerilla View in 3D 975 10.08.2010 The beauty of guerilla warfare is attacking an enemy that has their guard down, is unfamiliar with the terrain, and doesn't know who—or what—is engaging them. The beauty of being a two foot tall Yordle with a cannon the size of a mastiff hound is that no enemy would ever understand what hit them anyway. Elspeth Eastman Viktor Titov, Grafit Studio Commando Loot eligible Legacy Buccaneer View in 3D 520 27.06.2011 Gunners ahoy! Tristana leaps onto the high seas, sailing for new adventures beyond the Bandle borders. The hat's borrowed (stolen) from a pirate she blasted, and the eyepatch is purely for show. But her take-no-prisoner attitude and trusty cannon gun have sunk more ships than most captains in Bilgewater.

Buster Shot is a reference to the attack used by Megaman. Tristana has the fifth longest possible basic attack range in the game with 669 units at level 18, right after Kog'Maw when he uses his Bio-Arcane Barrage , which grants him a 710 attack range, Jinx's Fishbones at rank 5, which grants her a 725 attack range, Twitch when he uses Spray and Pray which grants him a total of 850 attack range, and Seraphine when she have full stacks(20 stacks) of her passive, Stage Presence , granting her a grand total of 1025 attack range(25 per note). This does not count champions that can have theoretically infinite range with stacking. Her dance references a typical soldier's stationary marching while singing a military cadence . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Tristana can attack the Baron Nashor over the back wall once she hits Level 15 due to the extra attack range she gains from Draw a Bead . Tristana is the only champion in the game who's passive ability Draw a Bead cannot do anything, under any circumstances, at level 1.
