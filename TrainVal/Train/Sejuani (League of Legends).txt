Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Blocked Missing Blocked Permafrost's targeting prioritizes champions within 50 of cursor, then non-champions within 50 of cursor, then champions within 350 of cursor, then closest unit to cursor within 2500 (this only applies if there is no target directly under the cursor). Frost stacks will not be applied if the basic attack is blocked . PENDING FOR TEST: : Permafrost's stack application interaction with parrying effects ( dodge , blind ). If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but still go on cooldown and pay its cost.

Magic Damage: 125 / 150 / 175 (+ 40% AP) If the bola travels over 400 units, it becomes empowered to detonate upon reaching maximum range or hitting an enemy champion, dealing increased damage and stunning for 1. 5 seconds instead. For the same duration, a frost storm is created around the location of the detonation that slows enemies within by 30% and grants sight of the area in a smaller radius. Increased Damage: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 80% AP) Afterwards, the storm shatters to deal magic damage to enemies hit and slow them by 80% for 1 second, as well as revealing them and granting sight of the area for 0. 5 seconds.

Original View in 3D 880 17.01.2012 Sejuani is the brutal, unforgiving Iceborn warmother of the Winter’s Claw, one of the most feared tribes of the Freljord. Her people’s survival is a constant, desperate battle against the elements, forcing them to raid Noxians, Demacians, and Avarosans alike to survive the harsh winters. Sejuani herself spearheads the most dangerous of these attacks from the saddle of her drüvask boar Bristle, using her True Ice flail to freeze and shatter her enemies.

[3] Her direct ancestor Serylda's name comes from two Germanic roots: *sarwo "armor, equipment" and *hildiz "fight, battle". Bristle might be inspired by the boar Gullinbursti from Norse mythology . She is referenced in Assassin's Creed Valhalla . [4] Sejuani is currently the champion with the shortest time between their initial release and a full visual game play update, at 1 year and 3 months. Sejuani, the Winter's Wrath Sejuani was the first champion released in 2012 . In Sejuani's Art Spotlight , the artist names the layer that has the boar on it "Piggles". A screenshot can be seen here. If Ashe , Lissandra , and/or Sejuani are played on opposing teams, Battle for Freljord will trigger. This in-game quest consists in one killing the other to earn the title of 'Queen of Freljord' (complete with a floating ice crown floating above their heads) referencing the civil war taking place there, between the three tribes each lead. Sejuani, Fury of the North Sejuani, Corki , Kled , Nunu , Rell , and Rumble are the only mounted champions. Sejuani is the only champion in the game that does not have a standard magic resistance scaling (30-38.5 or 32.1-53.35), though she does share this trait with Mega Gnar as he has different base stats to Gnar Sejuani, Karma , Lee Sin , and Trundle are the only champions to feature a 'traditional' skin representing them before their visual updates (hers was conceived after an unreleased 'Queen' skin ). Bristle's animations were recycled for the Tuskbeard monster from Odyssey: Extraction , a rotating game mode .
