Minions individually lose the empowerment when there are no more champions with Hand of Baron within 1500 units of them. Siege minions buffed by Hand of Baron will never enter turret range while attacking a turret and will instead remain outside of it as long as they keep line of sight. The splash damage of empowered siege minion attacks is tagged as Spell , AOE and proc . The amount of bonus AD and AP given is determined at the moment your team receives the buff upon killing Baron Nashor and does not increase over time.
