AD ratio per shot reduced to 50% AD from 60% AD . V10.19 - Added Daredevil Impulse (Innate) Innate - Style: Damaging basic attacks and abilities against at least one enemy champion different from the previous damaging hit made against them grants Samira a Style stack for 6 seconds, up to 6 stacks, refreshing on damaging attacks and abilities against enemy champions. The stack count is represented by the grades to the left of her health bar for Samira herself, and a stack counter underneath the bar that is visible to all units. Samira gains 0% − 21% (based on Style grade) bonus movement speed . Innate: Samira's basic attacks against targets in 200 range use her blade, becoming non-projectile . Basic attacks on-hit within this range and Blade Whirl , Wild Rush , and the slash and explosives of Flair deal 2 − 19 (based on level) (+ 10% AD) bonus magic damage , increased by 0% − 100% (based on target's missing health) . Additionally, Samira's basic attacks against immobilized enemies deal the attack's damage over 6 rapid attacks and knock up the target for 0. 5 seconds. This causes her basic attack timer to reset and the attack to become unstoppable . If the target is not within attack range, Samira will dash into it from up to 800 / 850 / 900 / 950 / 1000 (based on level) units and then attack. This effect cannot occur on the same target more than once every 10 seconds . The empowered attack can critically strike . On-hit effects are only applied once. Flair (Q) Active: Samira fires a shot in the target direction, dealing 0 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 (+ 100% AD) physical damage to the first enemy it hits. If a targetable enemy is in front of Samira , she will slash with her blade instead, dealing the same damage to all enemies hit in a cone. Casting Flair during Wild Rush will cause Samira to deploy explosives along her path which detonate upon the end of the dash, dealing the same damage to enemies within the covered distance. This can be done while performing Blade Whirl and Inferno Trigger . Both the shot and slash can critically strike for (25% + 25% ) bonus physical damage and apply life steal at full effectiveness. Mana Cost: 30. Cooldown: 6 / 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 seconds. Width: 120 / 130 . Cast Time: 0. 25 seconds. Speed: 2600 . Blade Whirl (W) Active: Samira slashes around herself twice over 1. 25 seconds, the first slash occurring immediately and the second being performed 0. 25 seconds before the duration ends, each one dealing 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 (+ 80% bonus AD) physical damage to nearby enemies. Samira destroys all hostile non- turret projectiles that enter or are in her vicinity during this time. Samira cannot attack nor cast Flair during Blade Whirl. Casting Inferno Trigger will end Blade Whirl early without performing the second slash. Mana Cost: 60. Cooldown: 30 / 28 / 26 / 24 / 22 seconds. Cast Time: None. Wild Rush (E) Active: Samira dashes in the direction of the target allied or enemy unit and slashes all enemies in her path, dealing 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+ 20% bonus AD) magic damage and gaining 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% bonus attack speed for 3 seconds. Takedowns on enemy champions reset Wild Rush's cooldown. Mana Cost: 40. Cooldown: 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 seconds. Target Range: 600 / 650 . Width: 100. Cast Time: None. Speed: 2050. Inferno Trigger (R) Active: Samira unleashes a torrent of shots from her weapons, rapidly shooting at all nearby enemies every 0. 2 seconds over 2 seconds, slowing herself by 25% and dealing 10 / 20 / 30 (+ 60% AD) physical damage with each shot, reduced by 75% against minions . Each shot can critically strike for (100% + 25% ) bonus physical damage and applies life steal at full effectiveness. Inferno Trigger cannot be cast unless the Style cost is satisfied, and will reset the grade back to 0 stacks when the effect ends. Samira cannot attack nor cast Flair or Blade Whirl during Inferno Trigger, but she is still able to move. Inferno Trigger will end prematurely by all forms of interrupting crowd control . Cost: 100 / 50 / 0 mana + 6 Style. Static Cooldown: 3 seconds. Cast Time: None. Taunt (Ctrl + 2) Taunt: If Samira does not interrupt the emote for 3 seconds, she tosses a coin in the direction she is facing. If she has at least 1 , the first enemy champion hit, including dead ones, takes an insulting 1 true damage but also receives 1 from Samira . If cast while a corpse of an enemy champion is within range, Samira will turn to face towards the closest one. This spell counts as an ability for Daredevil Impulse . Target Range: 950. Width: 120. Width: 1400.
