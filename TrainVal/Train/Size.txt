For other types of unit radii, see: Unit radius Size of a unit ( champions , minions , monsters , pets and player-generated terrain ) refers to their Gameplay Radius (also commonly known as hitbox radius ), rendered Model Scale and Selection Box size combined. Size modifiers always change their values simultaneously. Of these, Gameplay Radius is the most relevant for gameplay. Size plays a role for spells that calculate their range based on edge of the target's gameplay radius . In particular, targeted edge-to-edge spells add both their caster's and their target's gameplay radius to their range. Most notably, basic attacks are edge-to-edge spells. Main article: Range Projectiles ( Missiles ) have no gameplay radius , instead their hitbox depends on a width value. A unit's pathfinding radius is not directly related to their size and not modified by size modifiers .

Target dummies have a base gameplay radius of 65, like most champions. Their size can be up-to doubled (130), relevant for testing purposes, with a Command available in Practice Tool. Minions [ ] Melee minions and caster minions : 48 Melee minions empowered by Hand of Baron : 62. 4 Siege minions and super minions : 65 Siege minions empowered by Hand of Baron : 84. 5 Super minions empowered by Hand of Baron : 74. 75 Summoned Rift Herald : 88 (with modifier) Base size is 110 (Same as neutral Rift Herald ) Monsters [ ] Blue Sentinel : 131 Dragon (all types): 125 Gromp : 120 Red Brambleback : 120 Rift Herald : 110 Baron Nashor : 105 Ancient Krug : 100 Greater Murk Wolf : 80 Crimson Raptor : 75 Krug : 50 Murk Wolf : 50 Raptor : 50 Rift Scuttler : 50 Lesser Krug : 25 Pets [ ] Clones have the same unit radii as the champion they're copying.

They scale the unit's gameplay radius , model scale and Selection Box . PENDING FOR TEST: : Model scale and Selection Box have a cap. Gameplay radius does not/does have a cap. Champions [ ] Innate Thus far, Malphite and Zac are the only champions with the innate quality of constantly modifying their size . Their maximum size is increased by their current armor and bonus health â€‹, respectively (up-to +35% for both). For Zac , his current size additionally fluctuates based on his current health percentage (-30% at 0% health, regardless of his increase from bonus health ). Size Increase Aatrox's World Ender : +5% Cho'Gath's Feast : +6/8/10% per stack (based on rank), capped at +100% (also grants explicitly increased attack range) Jax's Grandmaster-At-Arms : +10% Kayle's Divine Ascent : +10%, grows over 1 second Lulu's Wild Growth : +40% Mordekaiser's Realm of Death (self) : +10%, grows over 0. 25 seconds and shrinks over 0. 25 seconds Nasus' Fury of the Sands : +30/35/40% (also grants explicitly increased attack range) Olaf's Ragnarok : +10% Renata Glasc's Hostile Takeover : +25% Renekton's Dominus : +20% (also grants explicitly increased attack range) Shyvana's Dragon's Descent : +0/8. 5 /16% (based on rank) (also grants explicitly increased attack range) Trundle's Subjugate (self) : +18%, gained in steps over a duration Volibear's Stormbringer : +35%, grows over 1. 25 seconds and shrinks over 0. 5 seconds (also grants explicitly increased attack range) Zyra affected by Leona's Sunlight : +10% (hidden passive) Size Reduction Trundle's Subjugate (target) : -9. 9 %, lost in steps over a duration Sona's Power Chord - Diminuendo (target) : -8% Mordekaiser's Realm of Death (target) : -10%, shrinks over 0. 25 seconds, but grows instantly Urgot's Mercy (target) : Minus a lot , lost in steps over a duration Size Conversion Kayn's Umbral Trespass overrides his size modifiers with the target's for the duration ( Kayn however cannot attack and is untargetable ). Neeko's Inherent Glamour copies both her ally's base size and current size modifiers. While disguised, any of her own size modifiers are ignored. Items [ ] While the following items do not explicitly increase the champion's attack range, they do increase the champion's size - allowing them to reach targets further away from their current location: Elixir of Iron : +15% Heartsteel : +3% per 1000 maximum health, maximum 30% Sterak's Gage : +10% Other [ ] Hand of Baron : +30% to Melee and Siege Minions and +15% to Super Minions Hullbreaker : +10% to Siege Minions and Super Minions . Grows over 0. 25 seconds and shrinks instantly. Rift Herald (summoned mercenary): -20% Rift Scuttler (first spawn): -13% Heimerdinger's H-28Q Apex Turret : +15% Practice Tool Command: Add bonus health to target; grants up to +100% size at +9000 bonus health (+1. 1 % size per 100 bonus health ). Poro-Snax : +X% size to Poro , can stack up to 10 times (at which point the Poro explodes) Scaling with size [ ] Tahm Kench's Tongue Lash's missile range and speed scale according to his bonus size. Negative size modifiers can reduce it, but not below its base range and speed. Bami's Cinder and its upgrades - the aura increases if the user increases in size, but is not impacted by their base size. The aura cannot get reduced below the base radii by negative size modifiers. Trivia [ ] Ivern is the first and only champion with 70 radius. Nobody knows why, exactly. [1] Trickster's Glass did not override the user's size modifiers with their target's, unlike Neeko's Inherent Glamour does today. Sentries (A removed small monster, two of which accompanied the Blue Sentinel ) had a radius of 50. Cinderlings (A removed small monster, two of which accompanied the Red Brambleback ) had a radius of 40. The immediately largest champion at the start of the game is Malphite due to his Granite Shield , with 82. 368 radius (further increased by armor from runes ). Sterak's Gage's and Maw of Malmortius' Lifeline used to increase their user's size by 25%/10% respectively, until the complete item shop overhaul in V10.23 (Preseason 11). Gargoyle Stoneplate 's active used to only grant 7% bonus size if less than 3 enemy champions were nearby. Last updated: V12.22 The largest size reachable is with Cho'Gath with a +210% modifier and total radius of 248 units: Cho'Gath (80 radius) Maximum Feast stacks (+100%) Heartsteel with 5 other Legendary items (+30%) Gargoyle Stoneplate Active (+25%) Elixir of Iron (+15%) Lulu's Wild Growth (+40%) For a total of 310% base size = 248 unit radius. This size may or may not correlate in-game as a soft cap or hard cap may exist. References [ ] â†‘ https://twitter.com/Squad5lol/status/1286432100795559936
