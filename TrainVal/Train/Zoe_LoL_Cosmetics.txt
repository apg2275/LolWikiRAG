(P) Thbptttttttt! Skillshots dodged with Portal Jump (R) Trivia [ ] Original Zoe Inspirations for Zoe are possibly: Various trickster figures in mythology around the world. [1] Her role as a celestial messenger might reference divine messengers such as Pre-Greek Hermes [2] & Semitic angels . Her Everchild epithet references the mythological puer aeternus . Zoe carries around a moonstone, a chime of Bard , and a key that belonged to Fiddlesticks, the Harbinger of Doom [3] [4] (Although it is still involved with The Ancient Fear ). Zoe’s color palette drew from several existing Targonian champions: Golden hair from Leona , blue clothes from Diana , silver tones from Taric , and the colors of the sky from Aurelion Sol . Cyber Pop Zoe This skin shares the Cyber Pop theme with: Cyber Pop Akshan Due to fan requests during the PBE cycle, [5] this skin was updated to display Heterochromia. Her right eye is blue, and her left is green. Spell Thief's bubbles can have a variety of emoticons in them: "(°☒°)", "(^-^)", "( ° ʖ °)", "^_^", "u_u", "=P", ":)", ";)". The balloons, which Spell Thief causes to float above some minions, contain an icon based on the blank sheet of paper that files which have no designated icon are displayed with by operating systems such as Microsoft Windows . The icon in the balloons has a star on it. Portal Jump's portals might be inspired by Portal. When the Sleepy Trouble Bubble trap is placed, it reads ".EXE", which is an executable program extension on Microsoft Windows . When the bubble is primed on an enemy, an image similar to the Blue Screen of Death shows up. Upon death, a screencap appears above Zoe's body. It shows the centre of Summoner's Rift (or middle lane) shaded gray, the death recap, and the HUD of Cyber Pop Zoe that lacks team frames and items. This screencap says that she died by Paddle Star . The background of her splash art was inspired by Splatoon and Blade Runner 2049 . Her appearance was inspired by the classic Splatoon girl. She also bears some resemblance to Futaba Sakura from Persona 5 , who is also voiced by Erica Lindbeck. Lollipoppy's lollipops are also in the bag she's carrying. One of her idle dances is based on the song Dare by Gorillaz . Pool Party Zoe Chromas: Amethyst,  Emerald,  Rainbow,  Rose Quartz,  Ruby,  Sapphire This skin shares the Pool Party theme with: Pool Party Caitlyn Pool Party Draven Pool Party Fiora Pool Party Graves Pool Party Leona ...and others Pool Party Miss Fortune Pool Party Orianna Pool Party Renekton Pool Party Sett Pool Party Mundo In her splash art, Nami along with Rift Scuttler , Beemo , Pool Party Lulu , Pool Party Miss Fortune , and Pool Party Ziggs can be seen inside the pool.

Ran, Zoe's familiar spirit, acts as her Sleepy Trouble Bubble and her second cast of Paddle Star . Ran also acts as Zoe's yo-yo in one of her walking animations. Ran is inspired by Tokyo Mew Mew 's infusers , jellyfish-like aliens that turn living creatures into monsters. Ran serves a similar purpose, acting as Zoe's corrupting bubble. Her fully corrupted form can be seen when she is in Portal Jump or is using Recall . This skin continues the jellyfish motif introduced by Cyber Pop Zoe .
