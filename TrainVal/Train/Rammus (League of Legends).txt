Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Parries Blocked Spiked Shell applies to structures . Edit Powerball Powerball COST: 60 Mana COOLDOWN : 16 / 13. 5 / 11 / 8. 5 / 6 CAST TIME: none COLLISION RADIUS: 75 EFFECT RADIUS: 250 Active: Rammus channels for up to 6 seconds to roll into a ball, gaining 25% − 39. 17 % (based on level) bonus total movement speed per second over the duration, up to a maximum of 150% − 235% (based on level) . Powerball can be recast after 1 second within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards or when interrupted . Rammus stops rolling upon colliding with an enemy, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies and knocking them back 125 units, though not through terrain. Enemies hit are then stunned and revealed for 0. 4 seconds, as well as slowed for 1 second. Magic Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 100% AP) Slow: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% Recast: Rammus ends Powerball . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Grounded Disruption Blocked Not Disabled Interrupted The initial cast and the manual recast count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. If the ability is not manually recasted, the secondary effect will trigger without being considered as an ability activation. The bonus movement speed stacks multiplicatively with other sources of movement speed boosts. Powerball will still collide with enemies if Rammus is ghosted . For the purpose of moving closer to an enemy when right clicking them, Powerball also reduces Rammus' attack range 「 to 0 」 「 by 125 」 for the duration. Regardless of this, during Powerball Rammus will also always attempt to path towards his target's center instead. Rammus will ignore unit collision for the purpose of pathfinding during Powerball . Rammus acts as if he were ghosted for the duration of Powerball . Powerball is not a movement channel , and so will not be interrupted by root and ground . Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun . The following table refers for interactions while Rammus is channeling : Type Channel Attacking Disabled Abilities Defensive Ball Curl interrupts. Frenzying Taunt is disabled. Soaring Slam modifies this ability. This ability recasts to end channel.

Edit Defensive Ball Curl Defensive Ball Curl COST: 40 Mana COOLDOWN : 7 CAST TIME: none Active: Rammus enters a defensive stance for 6 seconds, gaining bonus armor and bonus magic resistance . While active, enemies that use a basic attack on-hit against Rammus are dealt magic damage equal to Spiked Shell's bonus damage. Bonus Armor: 40 (+ 35 / 45 / 55 / 65 / 75% total armor) Bonus Magic Resistance: 10 (+ 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% total magic resistance) Rammus' basic attacks extend the remaining duration of Defensive Ball Curl by 0. 4 seconds, up to a maximum of 4 additional seconds. Defensive Ball Curl can be recast after 1 second within the duration, and does so automatically upon casting Powerball . Recast: Rammus ends Defensive Ball Curl . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Not Blocked The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Deactivating the ability manually does not. Defensive Ball Curl ends immediately if Powerball is cast. Defensive Ball Curl will return damage from attacks and/or abilities that apply on-hit effects ( Mystic Shot ) as well as from Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury (will not return damage from turrets , H-28G Evolution Turret , or Jack in the Box ). The resistance scaling will factor from all sources, including Defensive Ball Curl's flat bonus. This will recalculate over the duration. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Armor ratio changed to 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100% total armor . Magic resistance ratio changed to 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% total magic resistance . Edit Frenzying Taunt Frenzying Taunt COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 325 Active: Rammus taunts the target enemy champion or monster for a duration and gains bonus attack speed for the same duration. Taunt Duration: 1. 2 / 1. 4 / 1. 6 / 1. 8 / 2 Bonus Attack Speed Duration: 1. 2 / 1. 4 / 1. 6 / 1. 8 / 2 Bonus Attack Speed: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% The duration of the bonus attack speed continuously refreshes during Powerball , Defensive Ball Curl and Soaring Slam . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Non-Damaging Counters Spell shield Blocked Frenzying Taunt , despite being usable on monsters , does not force them to attack Rammus . He does not draw aggro since the ability does not deal damage. The bonus attack speed duration is separate from the taunt duration. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Taunt and bonus attack speed duration changed to 1. 6 / 1. 8 / 2 / 2. 2 / 2. 4 seconds. Edit Soaring Slam Soaring Slam COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 90 CAST TIME: None TARGET RANGE: 800 OR 150% movement speed EFFECT RADIUS: 400 / 200 / 400 SPEED: 900 / 2000 Active: Rammus leaps to the target location with immunity to crowd control . Upon arrival, he creates an impact that deals magic damage to nearby enemies and slows them for 1. 5 seconds. The impact deals increased damage at the epicenter if Soaring Slam was cast further than 800 units, capped at 1700 units with 50% increased damage. Magic Damage: 100 / 175 / 250 (+ 60% AP) Center Increased Damage: 150 / 262. 5 / 375 (+ 90% AP) Slow: 15 / 17. 5 / 20% If Soaring Slam was cast during Powerball , enemies within the epicenter are also knocked up for 0. 75 seconds and are dealt Powerball's damage. Powerball will not collide with enemies during the dash, and its channel will be maintained for the dash and end afterwards. Center Minimum Damage: 100 / 175 / 250 (+ 60% AP) (+ 100 / 130 / 160 / 190 / 220 (+ 100% AP) ) Center Maximum Damage: 150 / 262. 5 / 375 (+ 90% AP) (+ 100 / 130 / 160 / 190 / 220 (+ 100% AP) ) The impact causes 3 aftershocks to burst from the area over 3. 5 seconds, each one dealing magic damage to enemies within and applying the initial slow , which stacks up to 4 times. Magic Damage per Hit: 20 / 30 / 40 (+ 10% AP) Total Magic Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 (+ 30% AP) Maximum Slow: 60 / 70 / 80% Soaring Slam's damage affects structures and is doubled against turrets .

Spell shield will block the impact (including with Powerball ) but not each aftershock. Rammus is required to have had at least 461. 5 movement speed average over the last second to be able to cast Soaring Slam further than its minimum cast range and thereby deal the increased center damage. The maximum increased center damage is reachable once Rammus has had at least 1307. 69 movement speed average for the past second. Soaring Slam will not impact nor generate aftershocks if the dash is interrupted.

Original View in 3D 585 09.07.2009 Idolized by many, dismissed by some, mystifying to all, the curious being Rammus is an enigma. Protected by a spiked shell, he inspires increasingly disparate theories on his origin wherever he goes—from demigod, to sacred oracle, to a mere beast transformed by magic. Whatever the truth may be, Rammus keeps his own counsel and stops for no one as he roams the Shuriman desert.

Now he has become something wholly different, his power turned to nefarious ends at the hands of the evil invader-meeps. Duncan Watt West Studio Astronauts Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Astronaut Rammus Chromas Amethyst Catseye Citrine Emerald Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Rammus possibly plays on English verb ram & Latin masculine suffix -us . His dance references the back spin, a breakdance move . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. The ward skin Armordillo Ward references him. It is possible for Rammus to reach approximately 3104 armor in an "ideal" scenario. Details can be seen here . In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called "Rammurf" , referencing Urf . Out of all the champions in the game, Rammus has gone the longest without an update to his base splash art up until 2016 .
