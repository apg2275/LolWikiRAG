Drop The Beat Look Into The Future I'm Not A Rapper Run It Back League of Legends V14.2 [ ] Client [ ] Anti-cheat The current anti-cheat for the League of Legends Game client (which affects League of Legends & Teamfight Tactics) will be deprecated in favor of using Riot Vanguard . [1] , Riot's signature anti-cheat. Upon first launch of the League Client starting this patch, a diagnostic tool will run in the background in order to check if the system is compatible with Vanguard and ready for the update. If the check fails, it will run again automatically on later launches. This diagnostic can be manually executed through the Settings -> General -> Check for Compatibility . The software will not be required until a later date in the near future [ Retroactive editorial note : The launch of Vanguard was originally planned for patch 14.4, but in the next patch Riot announce that it will release in 14.5]. Challenges Lightning Round Wins on Howling Abyss reduced to before 10 minutes from 13 minutes. Chat Removed the pop out option for chat windows in the League Client.
