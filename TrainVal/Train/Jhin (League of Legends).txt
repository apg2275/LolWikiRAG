Jhin's basic attacks can critically strike . These attacks have slightly increased missile speed, but deal only 「 (150. 5 % + 34. 4 % ) AD physical damage . 」 「 86% of the critical damage champions usually have. 」 Jhin's attack speed cannot be improved at all except through growth . Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Basic damage Physical Counters Parries Projectile Blocked Blocked The 3000 missile speed for critical strikes also applies to Whisper's 4th shot, which is a guaranteed critical strike. Edit Whisper Whisper Innate - Death In 4 Acts: Jhin's basic attacks consume ammunition within 4 rounds. He will reload over 2. 5 seconds immediately after expending all rounds or withholding leftover rounds after 10 seconds of being out of combat and not being affected by crowd control . The latter reload can be interrupted by declaring an attack or casting an ability. Jhin's final round attack has an uncancellable windup versus champions, always critically strikes , including against structures , and deals bonus physical damage equal to 15 / 20 / 25% (based on level) of the target's missing health . Innate - Every Moment Matters: Jhin gains bonus attack damage equal to 4% − 44% (based on level) 「 (+ 0. 3 % per 1% critical strike chance) (+ 0. 25 % per 1% bonus attack speed) 」 「 (+ 30% critical strike chance) (+ 25% bonus attack speed) 」 AD . Additionally, critical strikes grant Jhin 10% (+ 0. 4 % per 1% bonus attack speed) bonus movement speed for 2 seconds. Link ▶️ "One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four." Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Physical Counters Parries Blocked The penalty to Jhin's critical damage also reduces the base damage ((100 + 75) × 0.86 rather than 100 + (75 × 0.86) and stacks with other sources (i.e Infinity Edge ) ((100 + 75 + 35) × 0.86). This penalty does not affect Curtain Call . The missing health damage benefits from life steal . The 4th attack cannot be canceled by Jhin himself. The 4th attack versus a structure is classified as a critical strike. The attack damage multiplier stacks additively with Dragon Slayer's . Every Moment Matters' bonus AD will benefit from any amount of bonus attack speed , even in excess of an amount that would usually reach the attacks per second cap (2. 5 ). The maximum modifier without attack speed is 74%. 44% base modifier at level 18. 30% from critical strike chance on account of the 100% cap. Attack speed slows will not affect Jhin's bonus attack damage from his passive and will ignore his attack speed as it is fixed. Attack damage reductions apply before the multiplier causing them to be stronger against Jhin than advertised or versus other champions. The bonus damage based on the target's missing health does not affect structures.

Original View in 3D 880 01.02.2016 Jhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder is art.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Jhin's Deutsch/German title, Der Virtuose , is the masculine form of Sona's title, Die Virtuosin . His dance references the Lezginka dance . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Jhin is the first champion who does not actually appear in his own Splash Art. Jhin is the second champion to have a Loading screen and Portrait icon not focus the actual champion, in his case, focus on the mirror image. The first one is LeBlanc . Jhin is the first champion to feature a takedown animation on his Classic skin, via Beauty in Death . It should be noted however that the passive effect is not solely for cosmetic purposes. Despite being the only one seen in-game, the rose is just one of the many things he sees when killing someone. [2] Occasionally when playing as Jhin, at the start of the game (between your team spawning at the fountain and then minions doing so at nexus) the player can hear a version of the map's theme that fits the style of Jhin's own. As Jhin, triggering The Collector Death and Taxes will cause the damage indicator to display as "4444" instead of "999". This change was added on V12.19 .
