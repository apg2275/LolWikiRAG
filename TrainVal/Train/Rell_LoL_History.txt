Basic attacks against enemy champions will refresh the duration for all nearby afflicted enemies. Rell gains bonus armor and bonus magic resistance equal to the sum resistances reduced from all afflicted enemies, and Break the Mold's bonus damage is increased equal to the sum resistances reduced from the target. Break the Mold will reduce the target's armor and magic resistance by a minimum of 5 − 12 (based on level) , or 0. 5 / 1. 25 / 2 (based on level) versus minions . Rell's attack windup is reduced 「 by 0% − 7. 14 % (based on level) . 」 「 to 47. 727 % − 44. 318 % (based on level) . 」 Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked Rell's buff accumulates enemies with Break the Mold's debuff and she will consequently lose a portion of the bonus resistances gained as afflicted enemies die. This is contrary to other effects described as "thefts" (e.g. Seismic Shard and Subjugate ) that are implemented by granting a buff to the caster that is proportionate, though independent, to the debuff applied to the target (i.e. in those instances, each persists for the full duration regardless). The attacks do not affect structures . Shattering Strike Shattering Strike COST: 50 mana COOLDOWN: 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 CAST TIME: 0. 35 RANGE: 685 / -150 WIDTH: 150 Active: Rell thrusts her lance in the target direction that completely destroys damage-mitigating shields of enemies hit before dealing magic damage , reduced to 50% against enemies beyond the first. The first enemy hit is also afflicted with Break the Mold . Magic Damage: 70 / 105 / 140 / 175 / 210 (+ 50% AP) Reduced Damage: 35 / 52. 5 / 70 / 87. 5 / 105 (+ 25% AP) If Rell is tethered with Attract and Repel , she and the bound ally heal for each enemy champion hit. Heal Per Champion Hit: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 (+ 30% AP) (+ 4% of missing health) Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Rell is locked out of moving, attacking, and casting any other ability except Attract and Repel for 0. 35 seconds after Shattering Strike is cast. Casting Attract and Repel will cancel Shattering Strike . The ability will not go on cooldown but will still expend mana . (bug) Shattering Strike , while binded to an ally, will grant the heal from hitting clones as well. Ferromancy: Crash Down Ferromancy: Crash Down COST: 40 Mana COOLDOWN: 11 CAST TIME: 0. 625 TARGET RANGE: 500 / 100 COLLISION RADIUS: 200 Passive: While Rell is Mounted , she gains 5% − 15% (based on level) bonus movement speed , which is only 20% − 40% (based on level) as effective for 3 seconds when she takes damage from non- minions and is removed for 4 seconds when she becomes immobilized or polymorphed . Active: Rell becomes Dismounted and leaps to the target location over the cast time, granting herself a shield that lasts until destroyed or casting Ferromancy: Mount Up . Upon arrival, she deals magic damage to nearby enemies and knocks them up for 1 second. She will continue sliding forward another 300 units over 0. 5 seconds , though not through terrain, affecting further enemies along her path. Shield Strength: 35 / 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 (+ 12% of maximum health) Magic Damage: 70 / 105 / 140 / 175 / 210 (+ 60% AP) While Rell is Dismounted , she can cast Ferromancy: Mount Up . Upon completing a Recall channel or respawning, Rell will automatically revert to Mounted form without casting the ability and reset Ferromancy: Mount Up's cooldown . This ability can be cast only while Rell is Mounted . Rell can cast Attract and Repel and Magnet Storm during the dash, and is not considered to be dismounted until after the leap ends. Ferromancy: Crash Down will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Link ▶️ "Armoring up!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Rell slides between 250 and 350 units in testing, depending on how far the spell was targeted. It is not known where this is intended. If Rell dashes before a wall on the map, the slide will cover a shorter distance to the terrain over the same time, moving slower. PENDING FOR TEST: Interaction with player-made walls. The following table refers for interactions while Rell is dashing/in cast time: Attacking Disabled Abilities Shattering Strike is disabled. Full Tilt and Magnet Storm are usable. Movement Disabled Items Usable All the other item-actives are usable Disabled Hextech Rocketbelt Stridebreaker Interrupted by N/A Consumables Usable Spells Usable Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Disabled Flash Teleport Recall Hexflash Interrupted by N/A Interrupted by Death Ferromancy: Mount Up Ferromancy: Mount Up COOLDOWN: 11 CAST TIME: 0. 25 Passive: While Rell is Dismounted , she gains 10% bonus armor and 10% bonus magic resistance , but her base movement speed is modified to 280 . She has a movement speed cap of 290 − 400 (based on level) . Active: Rell becomes Mounted and gains 15% bonus movement speed for 3. 5 seconds, increased while moving towards enemy champions . Increased Movement Speed: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45% During this time, Rell empowers her next basic attack to consume the bonus movement speed to have a 0. 2 -second cast time, gain 100 bonus attack range and cause her to charge at the target's location. Upon arrival or collision, she deals bonus magic damage , stuns the target for 1 second, and flings them 150 units over herself, though not through terrain. Bonus Magic Damage: 10 / 25 / 40 / 55 / 70 (+ 40% AP) While Rell is Mounted , she can cast Ferromancy: Crash Down . Ferromancy: Mount Up resets Rell's basic attack timer. This ability can be cast only while Rell is Dismounted . Link ▶️ "Mount up!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Grounded Blocked Blocked Not Disabled Knockdown See Notes Rell will always respawn and start the game as mounted. The basic attack reset is not considered one for Hail of Blades . Rell can use the empowered attack even while grounded or rooted . The dash can be knocked down but the attack's effects will still be applied. Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed. Attract and Repel Attract and Repel COST: 40 Mana COOLDOWN: 13 CAST TIME: 0. 35 / 0. 25 / None TARGET RANGE: 1500 EFFECT RADIUS: 250 WIDTH: 320 Passive: Rell forms a tether between her and the ally bound by Attract and Repel , and grants the ally 10% of her total armor and 10% of her total magic resistance while they are nearby. Active: Rell binds herself and the target allied champion nearest to the cursor with Attract and Repel . Rell can then recast Attract and Repel while the tether persists. Recast: Rell erupts the tether, dealing magic damage and stunning enemies between and around both herself and the bound ally for 0. 5 seconds. Magic Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 30% AP) Rell can self-target to dispel the current bind if she and her bound ally are not near enemy champions, and if she has not casted an ability nor taken damage from or attacked enemy champions within the last 3 seconds. Only one ally can be bound at a time, and selecting a new ally overrides the previous bind. Attract and Repel will incur a 2. 75 -second cooldown with no cost if Rell binds to an ally and a 1-second cooldown with no cost if she self-targets. Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit / Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked The effects render before the cast time. All units can see the effective area of the tether. Both conduits can see the tether range when within 600 units of it. Attract and Repel can be cast on allies even if they are untargetable . Rell has an arrow indicator that points to the other conduit. Depending on the distance it glows blue (0–900), yellow (900–2020), and red (2020+) Attract and Repel will be placed on a very short cooldown (less than 0. 1 seconds) when the tether is reapplied to the bound ally after the two become in tether range again. Rell immediately unbinds from tethered allies when they or she dies. Rell cannot begin, end, or erupt a tether by using the Self-Cast hotkey.
