Fiddlesticks can pretend to be an Effigy by standing still and not acting nor being acted upon for 2 seconds, during which it adjusts its body into a scarecrow and extends its arm out to expose its lantern. Innate - A Harmless Scarecrow: From level 6 onward, placing an Effigy also summons a Sweeper Drone at the location for 6 seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Vector Scarecrow Effigies are unavailable on ARAM until Fiddlesticks uses its Poro-Snax . The process of or the act of pretending to be an Effigy will be interrupted if Fiddlesticks : Moves. Takes damage. Declares an attack. Casts any ability or spell. Starts channeling . Is hit by an ability. Is affected by a crowd control effect. Effigies will mimic Fiddlesticks' idle animations and their health bars are hidden until they fake an action. If Fiddlesticks pretends to be an Effigy , its health bar stays hidden until the pose is interrupted. Effigies are considered clones . They are not valid targets to direction , ground , and auto-targeted effects for first 1. 5 seconds of their lifespan. The trinket slot can still be temporarily replaced by Eye of the Herald . - Surprise Party Fiddlesticks has a special icon for this ability. Edit Terrify Terrify COST: 65 Mana COOLDOWN: 15 / 14. 5 / 14 / 13. 5 / 13 CAST TIME: 0. 35 TARGET IMMUNITY : 15 / 14. 5 / 14 / 13. 5 / 13 TARGET RANGE: 575 Passive: While Fiddlesticks has been out of combat for at least 2. 5 seconds and is not visible to the enemy team, or is pretending to be an Effigy , its next damaging ability will additionally fear targets hit for a duration. Fear Duration: 1. 25 / 1. 5 / 1. 75 / 2 / 2. 25 Active: Fiddlesticks launches a crow at the target enemy that deals magic damage and fears them for a duration. Terrify has a minimum damage threshold and is capped at 400 against monsters . Magic Damage: 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of target's current health Minimum Damage: 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 Fear Duration: 1. 25 / 1. 5 / 1. 75 / 2 / 2. 25 Targets feared by Fiddlesticks by any means cannot be affected by it again for a duration equal to Terrify's cooldown. Against these targets, Terrify's damage and minimum threshold are doubled. Increased Magic Damage: 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20% (+ 4% per 100 AP) of target's current health Increased Minimum Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 Terrify slows affected targets by 90%. Hide Details Tips & Tricks Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked The fear-immunity timer is not refreshed by subsequent attempts to fear the target. The fear is applied at the end of the cast time , regardless of the target's distance or the missile landing. The missile cannot be destroyed, either. Fiddlesticks is considered "seen" if it is visible and is inside an enemy champion's sight radius . Vision from minions , wards , and turrets will not prevent Fiddlesticks from fearing if there are no nearby enemy champions. There is a very brief grace period after being seen or when entering combat. This can allow for multiple spells to inflict fear . Monsters are feared by Fiddlesticks's abilities when Fiddlesticks is out of combat, with some exceptions. If Fiddlesticks has recently damaged a monster from a camp with a basic attack or abilities (including Smite but not item active abilities), monsters in that camp will not be feared by his other abilities. Bountiful Harvest will not fear monsters unless Fiddlesticks is pretending to be an Effigy or is not visible to them. Minions are always feared if Fiddlesticks is not attacking them and there is no enemy champion in its view. The passive portion does not currently communicate any information to Fiddlesticks , its allies nor its enemies. There is no indicator to say that Fiddlesticks is out of combat; and no indicator or debuff icon on affected enemies. A visual indicator will circle around all enemy champions while Fiddlesticks is channeling Crowstorm if it is unseen. This is only visible to Fiddlesticks . The fear immunity applies even if the target is crowd control immune . It is not applied if it is blocked by spell shield . Terrify will still cast and affect the target even if Fiddlesticks dies or loses sight of them during the cast time. Terrify will still cast but not affect the target if they die or become untargetable during the cast time. There is no compensation. The player's screen will have a visual effect when successfully feared by Terrify . - Surprise Party Fiddlesticks has a special icon for this ability. Crowstorm will not fear enemy champions if cast while they have vision of Fiddlesticks , even if Fiddlesticks is pretending to be an Effigy . Tips & Tricks Nearsight reduces an enemy champion's sight radius, thus allowing Fiddlesticks to utilize the passive portion of Terrify more effectively. Map-Specific Differences One for All differences edit The fear-immunity is shared across all Fiddlesticks .

For all associated collection items, see Fiddlesticks (Collection) . Original View in 3D 585 21.02.2009 Something has awoken in Runeterra. Something ancient. Something terrible. The ageless horror known as Fiddlesticks stalks the edges of mortal society, drawn to areas thick with paranoia where it feeds upon terrorized victims. Wielding a jagged scythe, the haggard, makeshift creature reaps fear itself, shattering the minds of those unlucky enough to survive in its wake. Beware the sounding of the crow, or the whispering of the shape that appears almost human… Fiddlesticks has returned. Kellen Goff Kelly Aleshire Loot eligible Spectral View in 3D 520 16.03.2010 A gruesome spectre, rumored to stand eternally watchful over a peculiar book of fables. Brave knights and cruel sorceresses alike have tried in vain to reach the tome, but none have ever returned.

Frank Baum . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. He appears to be left-handed. His oldest splash art made a cameo in Fright Night along with Chinese Classic Karthus . In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called "8-bit-tlesticks" , referencing the 8-bit era of video games. The following changes were also jokingly listed: Crowstorm now triggers Terrify on all enemies caught in the area of effect. Notably, this mechanic was actually implemented in post- rework Fiddlesticks's kit due to Terrify's new passive. Terrify : fear duration has been increased to 10 seconds at all ranks. Fiddlesticks has been removed from the League. His pre- rework W ability, Drain , had its name reused by Vladimir for his ability in Teamfight Tactics Set 2. Fiddlesticks, The Ancient Fear The demonic symbol featured in his Champion Theme is a reference to Silent Hill's " Halo of the Sun ".
