Slaying the Rift Herald drops the Eye of the Herald at the entrance of the pit for 20 seconds, which can be picked up by one member of the slayer's team, and is used for summoning the Rift Herald Mercenary . Upon picking it up, the slayer's team also gains Glimpse of the Void . The Rift Herald only spawns once per game, and despawns permanently at 19:45 , or 19:55 if in combat. Baron Nashor spawns in her place at 20:00 . Features [ ] General [ ] The level of the Rift Herald is the average of all champions' levels when she spawns, with a minimum of level 6. When the Rift Herald loses all patience, she will hard reset , immediately running back to her camp. Passives [ ] Colossal Strength: The Rift Herald's basic attacks deal 4% of target's current health bonus physical damage . Monstrous Toughness: Effects that deal damage based on the Rift Herald's health and are not usually capped, are capped at 50 damage. Rift Herald's Gaze : Rift Herald takes 50% reduced damage from the unit that she has most recently attacked for 8 seconds, being effective only against one unit at a time. This damage reduction does not affect the bonus true damage dealt by hitting Rift Herald's eye. Warped Armor : The Rift Herald is immune to all crowd control , except stasis . Additionally, the Rift Herald's stats cannot be modified by any means. The Eye of Baron : The Rift Herald has a vulnerable eye on her back. Champion basic attacks against it deal 12% of Rift Herald's maximum health bonus true damage . When the eye is hit, it closes for 10 seconds, reduced by 2. 5 seconds every time she is struck by a champion's basic attack. The eye cannot open more than once every 3 seconds or if the Rift Herald is below 15% maximum health . Abilities [ ] Charge: At the start of the fight, the Rift Herald winds up for 2. 5 seconds to leap forward, dealing 200% AD physical damage to enemies within her path and knocking them aside , though not through terrain. While in the pit, she charges at the current location of the enemy who first damaged her. Swipe: At 65. 75 % and 32. 75 % of her maximum health , she winds up for 1. 5 seconds to strike in a cone in front of her, dealing 300% AD physical damage to enemies hit.

Bounty Gold Exp CS 25 95% / 116% of monster Herald exp reward 1 Statistics Health 3180 − 6360 (based on level) Attack damage 80 − 200 (based on level) Attack speed 0.5 Range 250 Armor 60 Magic res. 50 Mov. speed 425 Unit radius 110 Location Initial Respawn Once summoned via the Eye of the Herald . N/A The Eye of the Herald is a trinket that can be used to summon the Rift Herald Mercenary as an allied unit, which will relentlessly march down a lane to target enemy structures and push her way to the enemy Nexus . The summoned Mercenary has different statistics, effects and abilities than the pit Rift Herald . General [ ] She heads to the closest lane and starts pushing it. She aggroes the closest minions and targetable structures. Her level is the average of the levels of the champions of both teams the moment the Eye is picked up. She grants kill credit to the champion that summoned her as well as to the slayer's allied champions who participated in her takedown as the pit Rift Herald . Any units she kills and Turret Plating she destroys is accredited to these champions, granting them the kill gold. Passives [ ] Her basic attacks deal 1. 75 % of Rift Herald's current health bonus physical damage and knock back all enemy minions in front of her. The Eye of Baron : Every 3 seconds, the eye on Rift Herald's back will open. Champion basic attacks against the eye deal 40% of Rift Herald's maximum health bonus true damage . Abilities [ ] Rift Herald Rodeo: The Rift Herald allows for one allied champion to ride her and initiate a charge. They can target her to wind up over 0. 75 seconds, becoming attached to her afterwards. Once attached, the Rift Herald also winds up over 0. 75 seconds to let the player choose the starting direction of the charge by issuing a movement command . She then begins charging in the chosen direction for up to 12. 5 seconds, becoming displacement immune . The player can steer her charge in the direction of their cursor. Enemy champions hit along the way are dealt 250 true damage , and knocked up and stunned for 1 second. If the charge collides with an enemy structure or terrain , or reaches the end of its duration, the charge will stop, causing the Rift Herald to lose 66% of her current health , reduced to 13. 2 % if she hit terrain, and forcing the champion to detach from her and emerge from her back 200 units away, increased to 700 if the collision was against a targetable structure. The emerge distance increases by 75% of the champion's total attack range . If the charge collides with a targetable structure, the Rift Herald deals 1500 − 2250 (based on level) true damage to it. She also summons 5 (+ 1 − 6 (based on your team's Touch of the Void stacks) ) allied Voidmites that attack the nearest enemy structure, and grants the emerged champion a shield that decays over 4. 5 seconds. If the player champion does not choose a starting direction for the charge, the Rift Herald will charge in her facing direction. During the first 3 seconds of the charge, the Rift Herald's turn speed is increased, decaying every 2 seconds thereafter. The charge's speed is determined by the champion's movement speed. Their movement speed is set to a static 150 ramping up exponentially to 600 over the first 5 seconds. The value is increased by up to 75% while the charge is heading in the direction of an enemy structure, based on proximity to it, up to 1050 movement speed . During the windup and charge, the champion is rendered untargetable , invulnerable , displacement immune , and unable to act . They lose these effects after the charge ends. This effect cannot be used again until the Rift Herald has assisted in the destruction of an enemy turret. It also cannot be initiated if the Rift Herald is in combat with a structure. An icon of the buff for this effect is shown next to her health bar to indicate that it is available. Attempting to activate the effect while it is disabled will report to the player that it is on cooldown. If the Rift Herald dies while a champion is using this effect, the champion will re-appear at her death location with untargetability and crowd control immunity for 0. 1 seconds. Leap Attack: When the Rift Herald approaches a targetable structure, she winds up for 2. 5 seconds to leap to her attack range of the structure. Upon arrival, she headbutts the structure, dealing 1500 − 2250 (based on level) true damage . If the structure is successfully damaged, she loses 66% of her current health . Enemy champions near the impact of her attack are dealt 200% AD physical damage and knocked back . She is displacement immune during the wind up and the leap . Enrage: At 65. 75 % and 32. 75 % of her maximum health , she winds up for 1. 5 seconds to strike in a cone in front of her, dealing 300% AD physical damage to enemies hit. Duchess Smash: She disables the Reinforced Armor of nearby enemy turrets . Notes [ ] The Rift Herald loses her immunity to disables in summoned form. However, her wind up on structures cannot be interrupted . The damage Rift Herald inflicts to herself is internal raw damage . A unit representing the Eye of the Herald spawns at the entrance of the pit in the same moment the monster is slain, but only becomes able to be picked up after 2 seconds. The pickup is a repeating area check with 175 radius every 0. 264 seconds . Turrets affected by Bard's Tempered Fate causes the Rift Herald's charge to have no effect (she won't damage the tower nor inflict damage to herself). The Rift Herald , while summoned , can be healed by Fiora's Victory Zone . The Rift Herald will not wind up her charge against a nearby turret that is untargetable . The Rift Herald can be teleported by Ryze's Realm Warp . She can be teleported even while winding up on a structure or during her leap. She will still start her charge even after blinking during the windup (unless her windup completes during the 0. 75 seconds where she is unable to act, in which case she will not start her charge). If the Rift Herald's turret target is destroyed during the windup, she will instead charge at another nearby valid turret target instead. After using a basic attack once, she will then charge a second time at the same target. Strategy [ ] The summoned Rift Herald has a hefty amount of health and damage and several skills focused on taking down towers. The leap deals the same amount of damage regardless of current health, enabling the Rift Herald to rapidly destroy multiple turrets if left unchallenged. Since a summoned Rift Herald prioritizes minions and structures, it is not possible to distract her from smashing towers. The only way to stop the Rift Herald is to take it down. Trivia [ ] The Rift Herald was once a Rift Scuttler that has since mutated due to the Void energy emanating from Baron Nashor's pit. In the neutral monster form, the Rift Herald will dance if a champion dances nearby. In the summoned form, she will dance if she is still alive when a Nexus from either team is destroyed. If the Rift Herald is in range of two structures and winds up to charge at a structure that gets destroyed before she starts to charge, she will charge to the next available structure instead from the same wind-up. [1] In patch V7.9 , it was stated that Rift Heralds were exclusively female. From patch V5.22 to patch V7.9 , the Rift Herald had a wildly different appearance. It can be seen in the 'Skins' tab. While she looked like this, her animations were recycled from the Blue Sentinel's . Because of this, she shared its dance, which references Open the Door by Im Chang-jung . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . She also shared her dance with Daisy , another unit whose animations were borrowed from the Blue Sentinel's .
