Champions have the ability to summon these artificially intelligent units to assist them on the battlefield. There are three classifications of pets based on their control capacity: Controllable (i.e Ivern's Daisy ) - The pet does not have jurisdiction over its actions. Only the owner has the power to input commands such as attacking a target or moving to a location in order to force it to act. Most of the pets of this type have a leash range , more appropriately called a control range , which is a boundary they cannot physically pass and will always blink back to their owner if attempted so. Uncontrollable (i.e Spirits pulled by Illaoi ) - The pet is static and incapable of performing actions by themselves nor their owners. Self-Controlled (i.e Kalista's Sentinel ) - The pet has its own behavior and thrives on instinct, whose power is dependent on gameplay interactions such as detecting or attacking nearby enemies.

What each pet does at max leash range is dependent on a case by case basis, but the most common result is the pet blinks back to the caster's location. The following pets have this mechanic: Annie's Tibbers Ivern's Daisy Elise's Spiders Heimerdinger's H-28G Evolution Turrets Illaoi's Tentacles LeBlanc's Mirror Image Lulu's Pix Orianna's Ball Shaco's Clone Shen's Spirit Blade Zed's Shadow from Living Shadow Game-impacting pets [ ] Annie's teddy bear, Tibbers Aphelios' Sentry Azir's Sand Soldier Bard's Meeps Ekko's Afterimage Elise's Spiderlings Hecarim's Spectral Riders Heimerdinger's H-28G Evolution Turrets and H-28Q Apex Turrets and D.I.N.G.R.
