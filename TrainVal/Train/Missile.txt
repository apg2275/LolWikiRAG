A Missile is a type of entitiy in League of Legends . They are created by spell casts, for instance by most ranged champions' basic attacks. Missiles are not units . Behavior [ ] Missiles have the following properties: Width note that on the wiki we're currently using full width (equivalent to a circle's diameter), while Riot is using halfwidth in data (equivalent to a circle's radius) Range The maximum distance a missile travels before it destroys itself. Uncut Range Usually the same as range , but some missile achive their normal range only because they get destroyed early. Note that these missiles will have the center-range check at their uncut range's distance, so they can hit targets with center outside their usual 'range'. Speed The speed at which a missile travels. Missiles may have a minimum and maximum, as well as initial value for this if they have acceleration. Acceleration Some missiles change their speed during their travel time, which is what this governs. Path Some missiles just go in a straight line, some are homing onto a target, some use some different spline. Height Certain missiles follow ground height, others just gain their height relative to their caster's height at their creation. Gravity Some missiles will fly up into the air and/or come down, the speed of which is defined by this. Caster Missiles know who created them. Sight Some missiles reveal the area they're passing through. Destructiblity Many missiles are destructible by effects such as Windwall, however others, primarily those that carry only VFX, are not.
