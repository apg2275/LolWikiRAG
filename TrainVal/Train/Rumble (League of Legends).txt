Like most buffs, the stat bonus is already only gained at the next stat update (every 0. 264 seconds ). Despite this, the duration still inconsistent. Edit Electro Harpoon Electro Harpoon COOLDOWN: 0. 5 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RECHARGE: 6 RANGE: 950 / 890 WIDTH: 120 SPEED: 2000 Active: Rumble generates 20 Heat to shoot a harpoon in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first enemy hit, inflicting them with magic resistance reduction for 4 seconds and slowing them for 2 seconds. These effects stack additively with multiple harpoons, refreshing their duration and stacking up to 2 times. Magic Damage: 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160 (+ 50% AP) Total Magic Damage: 120 / 170 / 220 / 270 / 320 (+ 100% AP) Magic Resistance Reduction: 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18% Total MR Reduction: 20 / 24 / 28 / 32 / 36% Slow: 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35% Total Slow: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70% Rumble periodically stocks an Electro Harpoon charge, up to a maximum of 2.

Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked If Rumble lands a Harpoon on a target that already has a stack of magic resistance reduction while in Danger Zone , it will increase the reduction from this first stack to the enhanced amount, as well. A buff with the magic resistance reduction tooltip is applied to minions and pets , but their magic resistance is unaffected by Electro Harpoon . (bug) Each Electro Harpoon cast triggers Spellblade and stacks Force Pulse . Electro Harpoon's missile will fail to fire if Rumble is suppressed during the cast time. (bug) This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Rumble stocks an Electro Harpoon charge before the ability is even learned. Map-Specific Differences Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit Slow no longer stacks. * Edit The Equalizer The Equalizer COOLDOWN: 130 / 105 / 80 CAST TIME: None / 0. 5833 TARGET RANGE: 1700 RANGE: -175 / 1135 WIDTH: 410 - 368. 4 SPEED: 1600 Active: Rumble deploys a barrage of rockets along the target path that land in a line over 0. 75 seconds, creating a field of fire for 4. 5 seconds after the last rocket lands. Enemies struck by the impact or within the field are marked as Burning for 1 second, which deals magic damage every 0. 5 seconds, slows by 35%, and refreshes continuously while in the area. Magic Damage Per Tick: 70 / 105 / 140 (+ 17. 5 % AP) Minimum Magic Damage: 140 / 210 / 280 (+ 35% AP) Maximum Magic Damage: 700 / 1050 / 1400 (+ 175% AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Vector Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Not Blocked Not Blocked A static target standing where the missiles first impact may take an extra tick of damage (11 ticks), while a static target standing at the end of the trail may take one fewer tick (9 ticks). (bug) The Equalizer's hitbox consists of a row of rockets with a circular damage hitbox each. The radius of each is 205 units, and rockets drop at a distance of 180 units between one another when The Equalizer is cast. The missile that manages the rockets being deployed starts 150 units behind the target vector origin, and thus drops the first rocket at 30 units in front of the cast vector origin after 0. 132 seconds . The rockets are intended to not deal damage for the first 0. 25 seconds. Due to a bug, this becomes 0. 25 -0. 5 seconds 'at random'. If Rumble dies while The Equalizer is just cast, this buff will be removed by death and the area of effect will start dealing damage sooner.

Original View in 3D 880 26.04.2011 Rumble is a young inventor with a temper. Using nothing more than his own two hands and a heap of scrap, the feisty yordle constructed a colossal mech suit outfitted with an arsenal of electrified harpoons and incendiary rockets. Though others may scoff and sneer at his junkyard creations, Rumble doesn't mind—after all, he's the one with the flamespitter.

Nothing like plunderin' and maraudin' to lend Rumble a new lease on life as he terrorizes the coasts. Ari Rubin Feihong Chen Bilgewater: Burning Tides Loot eligible Legacy Super Galaxy View in 3D 1820 02.04.2014 Founder of the Super Galaxy Defense Force, Rumble always dreamed of saving the world… with his “explosive face-melters” and “courageous giga-guards”. To this day, his allies still have no idea what those terms mean, but they don't question it—because a yordle operating a volcanic flame-spitting mech can be a very volatile thing. Ari Rubin Andrew 'Silver' Silver Super Galaxy Loot eligible New voiceover New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Badlands Baron View in 3D 1350 11.04.2018 Nothing turns a traveler's blood cold like seeing Rumble in the distance, his iron death buggy chugging thick clouds of irradiated smoke. That means someone's got his attention, and those with Rumble's attention have a nasty habit of becoming very, very dead.
