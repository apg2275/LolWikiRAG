The skins will still appear in drops and rerolls during 12.5, but only those who earned them pre-12.5 will receive a special version of these skins. Prestige and Gemstone skins will be removed from loot drops and rerolls when the Mythic Content Overhaul begins. Ranked Borders and Divisions Ranked borders in loading screens updated. Ranked divisions will be visible in game lobbies, hovercards, loading screens, and profiles.
