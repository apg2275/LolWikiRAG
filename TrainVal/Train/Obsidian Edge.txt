Similar items Emberknife Hailblade Notes Auto-Path will only affect the Blue Sentinel and Red Brambleback within the user's side of the jungle. Spells that 「 deal default damage or proc damage 」 「 do not trigger on-hit or spell effects 」 will not trigger the burn, unless special cased to do so. Teemo's Toxic Shot is special cased to trigger it despite being proc damage . Other special cased interactions are not listed here. The Sear damage does not deal lethal damage to large jungle monsters with buffs (i.e. Blue Sentinel and Red Brambleback ). This is so that the burn does not accidentally steal a buff that's being donated.
