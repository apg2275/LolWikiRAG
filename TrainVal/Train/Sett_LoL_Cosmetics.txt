[1] Sett is more human than animal due to only being half Vastayan. [2] He shares the beast folk appearance traits from popular anime where only his hair area indicates his beastial physical traits (ears). Sett's general appearance was inspired by characters from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure . His It Was Me! emote is a reference to Dio Brando and the It Was Me, Dio! meme . The development loading screen had JoJo menacing ゴゴゴゴ letters on it. Sett's Japanese voice actor, Takehito Koyasu, also voices Dio Brando from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure .
