On arrival, grants 50% bonus total movement speed for 3 seconds. Cooldown 330 − 240 (based on level) seconds Range Global Breaks stealth No Summoner level 7 Availability SR HA NB AR Teleport is a unit-targeted summoner spell that blinks your champion to the target allied unit after a few seconds of channeling . Teleport transforms into Unleashed Teleport after 10:00 . Notes [ ] Transformation VFX Transformation VFX Unleashed Teleport will be placed on a 2-second cooldown after Teleport's transformation. If Teleport's current cooldown is greater than Unleashed Teleport's maximum cooldown upon transformation, the current cooldown is reduced to its maximum. Teleport has no cast time. Teleport goes on cooldown after the channel ends. Teleport is disabled while grounded , rooted , or unable to cast. Nearsight will prevent the caster from using Teleport globally. When the ground instead of a unit at least 3000 units away, the game will search for a nearby valid target to teleport to. This is particularly useful when targeting via the minimap. The target's location at the start of the channel will be considered for the destination location of Teleport , not the target's location when the channel completes. Teleport is canceled if a targeted turret is destroyed during the channel. Unleashed Teleport is not canceled if a targeted ward or trap expires or a minion dies during the channel. Unleashed Teleporting to a ward or stealthed trap reveals it to enemies. The target ward or trap is only revealed if it is within an enemy's sight radius and their sight isn't being obstructed. Unleashed Teleport grants invulnerability to the targeted minion , ward or trap and stuns them for the channel. It is possible to use Unleashed Teleport on a minion that is aggroed by an enemy turret when teleporting to assist a push, preventing turret damage against the minion for about 4 seconds. The Nexus Obelisk does not ignore invulnerability of minions, unlike against champions, allowing the same trick to work against it, too. Furthermore the Nexus Obelisk does not swap targets until its current target becomes unavailable to be attacked. The user may select their target for Teleport via the minimap. Teleport's visual effects can be seen even through the fog of war. While standing at the end of a wall or other standing out part of terrain, using Teleport slightly increases sight radius just around the corners in the fog of war. The teleporting champion will always appear on the side of the object that is facing towards own nexus. The distance from a turret the caster arrives at is 225 units, and from other unit types the offset is 100 units. Prior to V6.13 , when a turret was targeted, a random location around it was chosen. [1] Teleport does not cancel the user's current movement or attack order, which the champion will continue pursuing after the channel ends, unless a new one is given. Successfully completing the channel will destroy any targeted missiles inbound that would otherwise follow the user to the new location.

Teleport can be used to react if an enemy champion tries to destroy an unguarded turret . Teleport can be used as an escape if the enemy champions lack cast-inhibiting crowd control . Unleashed Teleport can be used to join fights and set up flanks by Teleporting to a friendly minion , ward , or any targetable allied summoned unit. Unleashed Teleport can be used on an allied summoned unit such as Zac's Bloblets making them invulnerable for the duration of Teleport's channel. If Unleashed Teleport's target's duration times out or disappears for any reason before the channel completes, the user will still be teleported to the target's initial location. Targets [ ] In addition to any friendly minion or turret , Unleashed Teleport can be used on a number of allied summoned units. These include, but are not limited to: Wards Fiddlesticks' summoned Effigies Jarvan IV's Demacian Standard Thresh's Dark Passage Zac's Bloblets Rek'Sai's tunnel entrances Illaoi's Tentacles Pets such as Annie's Tibbers , Heimerdinger's Turret , and Malzahar's Voidlings .

Clones such as Shaco's Hallucinate and LeBlanc's Mirror Image ( Fiddlesticks' Effigies are still targetable). Trivia [ ] The first icon of Teleport was a purple variant of the first icon for Recall . Prior to being a summoner spell, the alpha items Ancient Pocket Watch and Scroll of Teleportation served the same function as Teleport . Teleport was also a boot enchantment that shared the same name as this summoner spell during the Black Market Brawlers event. Details are shown in the section below.
