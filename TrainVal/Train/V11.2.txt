Viego - New champion Sovereign's Domination (Innate) Innate: Whenever an enemy champion is killed by Viego or dies within 3 seconds of being damaged by him, a Mist Wraith spawns from their corpse for 8 seconds. Viego can basic attack a Mist Wraith to possess it, heal himself for 8% (+ 2. 5 % per 100 bonus AD) (+ 1. 5 % per 100 AP) (+ 2. 5 % per 100% bonus attack speed) of the target's maximum health , and blink to its location after winding up for 1 second, during which he is untargetable (except to turrets ). Possession lasts for 10 seconds and replaces Viego's basic attacks, basic abilities, items, base stats (based on Viego's level), and appearance with the champion the Mist Wraith was summoned by and grants him a free cast of Heartbreaker that is initially placed on a 1. 5 -second cooldown. Viego also gains 10% bonus movement speed while moving toward nearby enemy champions during this time. Viego cannot use item actives, consumable items, nor the shop while under possession . Viego will preserve his current health percentage between transformations. Blade of the Ruined King (Q) Passive: Viego's basic attacks deal 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6% of the target's current health bonus physical damage on-hit . The bonus damage has a minimum threshold of 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 and is capped at 80 against monsters . Additionally, Viego's damaging abilities apply a mark to enemies for 4 seconds. Viego's next basic attack against a marked target consumes the mark to strike twice, with the second strike dealing 20% AD (+ 15% AP) physical damage and healing him for 150% of the post-mitigation damage dealt, increased to 155% against monsters. The second strike is affected by critical strike modifiers and, while not under possession , it applies on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness. Active: Viego thrusts his blade in the target direction, dealing 25 / 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 (+ 60% AD) physical damage to enemies hit, increased by 0% − 75% (based on critical strike chance) , and 10 bonus physical damage against monsters. Blade of the Ruined King's passive remains under possession . Cooldown: 5 / 4. 5 / 4 / 3. 5 / 3 seconds. Target Range: 600. Width: 125 . Cast Time: 0. 35 seconds. Spectral Maw (W) Active: Viego charges while being slowed by 15% for up to 3 seconds to increase Spectral Maw's mist missile range and stun duration over the first second of the channel. Spectral Maw can be recast at any time within its duration. If the charge completes without reactivation, Spectral Maw is canceled and goes on full cooldown. Recast: Viego hurls a blast of mist in the target direction and dashes a fixed distance in the same direction, though not through terrain. The mist deals 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 100% AP) magic damage to the first enemy struck and stuns them for 0. 25 − 1. 25 (based on channel time) seconds. If the charge is interrupted , Spectral Maw resumes a reduced 3-second static cooldown. Spectral Maw resets Viego's basic attack timer. Cooldown: 8 seconds. Target Range: 300 / 500 − 900 (based on channel time) . Width: 120. Speed: 1000 / 1300 . Cast Time: None. Harrowed Path (E) Active: Viego sends a spectre in the target direction that creates a trail of mist along its path which lasts 8 seconds. The mist spreads around the first instance of terrain encountered. While inside the mist, Viego gains 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% bonus attack speed and, if he is not attacking or casting, he becomes camouflaged and gains 20 / 22. 5 / 25 / 27. 5 / 30% (+ 4% per 100 AP) bonus movement speed . Declaring a basic attack or casting an ability will break the camouflage and remove the bonus movement speed , preventing Viego from gaining them again for 0. 6 seconds, refreshing upon further attacks and ability casts. Harrowed Path can be cast during any of Viego's abilities. Cooldown: 14 / 12 / 10 / 8 / 6 seconds. Detection Radius: 400. Cast Time: None. Heartbreaker (R) Active: Viego discards his current possession if he has one and gains displacement immunity over the cast time, then blinks to the target location. Upon arrival, Viego creates a blast that deals 120% AD physical damage to all nearby enemies, increased by 0% − 75% (based on critical strike chance) , and knocks back all but one up-to 400 units away based on proximity. The most wounded enemy champion, alternatively the closest one , is not knocked back and instead takes the blow from Viego's blade, which deals 15 / 20 / 25% (+ 3% per 100 bonus AD) of the target's missing health bonus physical damage , slows them by 99% for 0. 5 seconds, and applies on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness. If a possession is discarded, Heartbreaker will be placed on a 1. 5 -second cooldown if it is not already on cooldown. Cooldown: 120 / 100 / 80 seconds. Target Range: 500. Effect Radius: 300. Cast Time: 0. 5 seconds.

Removed: Spell shards no longer drop the active for Redemption . Bug Fix: Casting Spell Thief with a shard of an item in her inventory no longer causes that actual item to go on cooldown.
