For the health relic on the removed map Twisted Treeline , see Ghost Relic . For the health relic on the removed map Crystal Scar , see Health Relic (Crystal Scar) . Health Relic Health Relics are objects in the Howling Abyss that can be picked up by champions to restore health and mana . They are located in four spots along the map: in front (outer relic) and behind (inner relic) the outer turrets in each team. Outer health relics spawn at 1:45 and inner health relics spawn at 2:30. After a relic is picked up, it will respawn after 90 seconds. Effects [ ] Health Relic trigger Health Relic beam strike Restores 8% of missing health and 8% of missing mana to the champion who picks up the relic. After being picked up, triggers a beam of light to strike the ground after 2. 5 seconds, restoring 16% of missing health and 16% of missing mana for all champions within. Notes [ ] Health Relic spawn timers Health Relic available The heal counts as self- healing and is affected by healing modifiers. When viewing the scoreboard (default: holding Tab or toggle with O ), the timers for the 4 health relics can be seen at the top of the screen. The spawn location is considered river in special cases such as Gift of the Drowned Ones and Terrashape . Strategy [ ] Placing traps on a health relic is a good strategy as the relic will act as a bait. As the Spawn in Howling Abyss does not grant any regeneration, Health Relics are useful to restore health and mana after combat.
