Evolving an ability causes her to enter a 2-second cast time . The upgrade is lost if the stat requirement is no longer met. Innate - Plasma: Kai'Sa's basic attacks on-hit and Void Seeker apply stacks of Plasma to enemies for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 5 times. Basic attacks each apply 1 stack and Void Seeker applies 2 stacks, increased to 3 if it is evolved . Her and nearby allies' immobilizing effects and polymorphs against enemy champions will also apply a stack of Plasma . Innate - Caustic Wounds: Plasma stacks applied by Kai'Sa's basic attacks or Void Seeker deal 5 − 23 (based on level) (+ 1 − 12 (based on level) per Plasma stack before application) (+ 15% − 25% (based on Plasma stacks before application) AP) bonus magic damage . The fifth stack against a target consumes them all to deal additional bonus magic damage equal to 15% (+ 6% per 100 AP) of the target's missing health , capped at 400 against monsters . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries See Notes Blocked Kai'Sa receives the evolution even if she dies while in cast time. Kai'Sa can evolve an ability even if she hasn't learned it yet. The bonus missing health damage is evaluated after the initial damage from Caustic Wounds is evaluated, and after Void Seeker's damage if triggered by it, but before a triggering basic attack's is. This effectively increases the "flat" Caustic Wounds damage preceding the expunge proc and (if applicable) Void Seeker damage and any potential preceding on-hit damage (usually not possible to acquire due to buff slot order) by 15% (+ 6% per 100 AP) divided by (1+ the target's MR post penetration /100). Plasma stacks that exceed the rupture are reapplied normally. Spell shield will block the Plasma application from Void Seeker only. With Void Seeker , if the stacks detonate Plasma , any remaining stacks are reapplied afterwards. Void Seeker also deals Caustic Wounds' damage based on Plasma stacks on the target. This damage is calculated as if each stack was applied successively. Hitting a target with 0 stack with normal Void Seeker : 10 − 46 (based on level) (+ 1 − 12 (based on level) (+ 32.5% AP) Hitting a target with 3 stacks with normal Void Seeker : 10 − 46 (based on level) (+ 7 − 84 (based on level) (+ 47.5% AP) Hitting a target with 0 stack with evolved Void Seeker : 15 − 69 (based on level) (+ 3 − 36 (based on level) (+ 52.5% AP) Hitting a target with 2 stacks with evolved Void Seeker : 15 − 69 (based on level) (+ 9 − 108 (based on level) (+ 67.5% AP) Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit On-hit damage changed to 50% value.

Minions below 35% health take double damage. Physical Damage Per Missile: 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 (+ 50% bonus AD) (+ 20% AP) Non-minions take 25% damage from missiles beyond their first. Reduced Damage Per Missile: 10 / 13. 75 / 17. 5 / 21. 25 / 25 (+ 12. 5 % bonus AD) (+ 5% AP) Total Single-Target Damage: 90 / 123. 75 / 157. 5 / 191. 25 / 225 (+ 112. 5 % bonus AD) (+ 45% AP) Evolution : Requires 「 100 − 56 (based on level) attack damage from items 」 「 100 attack damage from items and stat growth 」 to upgrade – Icathian Rain instead fires 12 missiles. Total Evolved Single-Target Damage: 150 / 206. 25 / 262. 5 / 318. 75 / 375 (+ 187. 5 % bonus AD) (+ 75% AP) A nearby enemy is required to cast this ability. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked The first missile on a target applies area damage , while the rest on the same target apply persistent area damage . Spell shields only block the damage from a single missile. Icathian Rain acquires its targets upon cast. Moving will not change its targets. Charging Supercharge will not stop the missiles from firing. It takes 1 second for all missiles to fire at a single target. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Bonus AD ratio per missile changed to 40% bonus AD . AP ratio per missile changed to 15% AP .

Magic Damage: 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 (+ 130% AD) (+ 45% AP) Evolution : Requires 100 ability power from items to upgrade – Void Seeker applies 3 Plasma instead and refunds 75% of its cooldown if it hits an enemy champion .

Edit Supercharge Supercharge COST: 30 Mana COOLDOWN: 16 / 14. 5 / 13 / 11. 5 / 10 CAST TIME: 1. 2 − 0. 6 (based on bonus attack speed) Active: Kai'Sa charges up over the cast time, during which she is still allowed to move, becomes ghosted , and gains bonus movement speed , with the effectiveness increased by 0% − 100% (based on bonus attack speed) . Minimum Movement Speed: 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 / 75% Maximum Movement Speed: 110 / 120 / 130 / 140 / 150% After completing the charge, she gains bonus attack speed and reduces her basic attack windup percentage by 6. 44 % for 4 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% Supercharge's current cooldown is reduced by 0. 5 seconds on-attack . Evolution : Requires 「 100% − 70% (based on level) attack speed from items 」 「 100% attack speed from items and stat growth 」 to upgrade – Supercharge grants invisibility at the start of the cast time for 0. 5 seconds. Hide Details Tips & Tricks Info Targeting input Auto Her attack commands during this time are switched to movement commands instead. Upon finishing the charge and if an attack command was issued, Kai'Sa will continue walking toward her target. Kai'Sa behaves normally if attack move click was issued not on a target during the cast time, stopping at attack range of the closest target and starts attacking when charged up. Tips & Tricks If Supercharge's cast time finished while its buff is still active, the movement speed buff lingers briefly longer. This is only possible with a significantly high amount of ability haste and attack speed . Edit Killer Instinct Killer Instinct COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 130 / 100 / 70 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 1500 / 2250 / 3000 EFFECT RADIUS: 525 Active: Kai'Sa grants herself a shield for 2 seconds and dashes to a target location near a visible enemy champion that was affected by Plasma within the last 4 seconds. The shield's duration is refreshed when the dash ends. Shield Strength: 70 / 90 / 110 (+ 90 / 135 / 180% AD) (+ 120% AP) A nearby enemy champion affected by Plasma is required to cast this ability. Killer Instinct resets Kai'Sa's basic attack timer. Kai'Sa can cast any of her abilities during the dash. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted Kai'Sa will issue a movement command to the targeted location regardless of whether the target location is valid. The dash is not buffered during this movement command. Kai'Sa will not dash if the targeted location becomes valid by walking in range or a nearby enemy champion becomes affected by Plasma . If the targeted location is not valid, the range indicator will glow. The enemy champion recently affected by Plasma must be in range of Kai'Sa for the targeted location to be valid, and not the targeted location itself. The basic attack reset is not considered one for Hail of Blades . Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins. For all associated collection items, see Kai'Sa (Collection) . Original View in 3D 975 07.03.2018 Claimed by the Void when she was only a child, Kai’Sa managed to survive through sheer tenacity and strength of will. Her experiences have made her a deadly hunter and, to some, the harbinger of a future they would rather not live to see. Having entered into an uneasy symbiosis with a living Void carapace, the time will soon come when she must decide whether to forgive those mortals who would call her a monster, and defeat the coming darkness together… or simply to forget, as the Void consumes the world that left her behind.
