Gameplay Collection Audio Patch history Past versions Current version [ ] V14.2 - January 24th Hotfix Smoke Screen Bug Fix: No longer grants an immensely large and recursive amount of adaptive force and hybrid resistances to champions who simultaneously have spells that echo consistent statistic updates and have the Unflinching rune equipped. [1] V13.22 Quickdraw Bonus armor per stack reduced to 2 / 5 / 8 / 11 / 14 from 4 / 7 / 10 / 13 / 16. V13.18 General Updated ability icons.

Previously, the invisible attack missile that manages interactions such as damaging wards naturally brought along the Energized proc on-attack.
