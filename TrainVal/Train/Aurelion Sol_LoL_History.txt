Each Star deals 12 − 120 (based on level) (+ 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 (based on Celestial Expansion's Rank) (+ 25% AP) magic damage to enemies that come into contact with them as well as executes enemy minions that have less than 25 health , including if they are brought to or below that threshold. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked The Stars orbit counterclockwise around Aurelion Sol . Aurelion Sol's Stars have independent vision hitboxes, meaning that they may remain visible even while he is within a brush , and must be in the brush themselves in order to be hidden. An individual Star must complete at least one third of its orbit before it can damage the same target again. In the event that an enemy orbits around Aurelion Sol at the same rate as his Stars without leaving their hitbox, they will take damage once every third of the way around.

Starsurge can be recast after 0. 25 seconds while the star is active, and does so automatically when the star travels beyond the Outer Limit . Recast: Aurelion Sol detonates the star, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies and stunning them for a duration, which is increased by 0% − 300% (based on time traveled) .

Comet of Legend can be recast after 1. 5 seconds during flight, and automatically does so at maximum range or upon taking damage from enemy champions or turrets . Recast: Aurelion Sol ends Comet of Legend early. Taking champion or turret damage while Comet of Legend is not active places it on a 4-second static cooldown .
