Allied champions' damaging attacks and abilities against a marked target will consume the mark to deal 32 − 168 (based on level) bonus magic damage . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Sunlight's mark damage is credited to the allied champion and not to Leona . The damage will benefit from allies' magic penetration and will apply any spell effects and spell vamp they have. PENDING FOR TEST: : Omnivamp Zyra has a hidden passive that grants her 10% increased size for 33 seconds after having Sunlight applied to her. Edit Shield of Daybreak Shield of Daybreak COST: 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 Mana COOLDOWN : 5 CAST TIME: none Active: Leona illuminates her shield, empowering her next basic attack within 6 seconds to have a 0. 25 -second cast time, gain 50 bonus range , deal bonus magic damage and stun the target for 1 second. Bonus Magic Damage: 10 / 35 / 60 / 85 / 110 (+ 30% AP) Shield of Daybreak resets Leona's basic attack timer. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Blocked Missing The enhanced attack will apply other on-hit effects and can critically strike as normal. Critical strikes do not interact with Shield of Daybreak's bonus damage. PENDING FOR TEST: : Shield of Daybreak's interactions with dodging , blocking , and blinding effects. Shield of Daybreak's attack does not put Leona's basic attack on cooldown. (bug) This effectively performs a second attack reset . This is unlike other empowered attacks (including those which, similar to Shield of Daybreak , use a more unconventional spell cast rather than an attack override). Leona will wait out Shield of Daybreak's wind-down before automatically attacking, anyway. The player must issue the next attack themselves to gain the full benefit of the second reset. Probably not a bug because her High Noon skin gives the second attack a new distinguishable attack animation, which means that it's designed so. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed. The empowered attack will not trigger against buildings . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 6 seconds. Edit Eclipse Eclipse COST: 60 Mana COOLDOWN : 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 450 Active: Leona raises her guard for 3 seconds, gaining flat damage reduction of up to 50% of the damage instance and bonus armor and bonus magic resistance . Flat Damage Reduction: 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 Bonus Armor: 20 / 27. 5 / 35 / 42. 5 / 50 (+ 20% bonus armor) Bonus Magic Resistance: 20 / 27. 5 / 35 / 42. 5 / 50 (+ 20% bonus magic resistance) Her shield detonates after the duration, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies. If this hits an enemy, Leona's guard is extended for an additional 3 seconds. Magic Damage: 55 / 90 / 125 / 160 / 195 (+ 40% AP) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield See Notes Neither the cast nor detonation of Eclipse interrupts any of Leona's previous orders or ongoing attack windups. The resistance scaling will factor from all other sources, excluding Eclipse's flat bonus. This will recalculate over the duration. Spell shield will block the damage but Eclipse's extended duration will not be prevented. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 14 / 13. 5 / 13 / 12. 5 / 12 seconds. Edit Zenith Blade Zenith Blade COST: 60 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 10. 5 / 9 / 7. 5 / 6 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 900 WIDTH: 140 SPEED: 2000 Active: Leona projects her sword in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies hit. Magic Damage: 50 / 90 / 130 / 170 / 210 (+ 40% AP) If she hits at least one enemy champion , she will dash 225 units behind the last one struck within 3000 range and root them for 0. 5 seconds. Leona is unable to move or attack while Zenith Blade is in flight. She can cast any of her abilities during the dash. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded Blocked Blocked Disabled Knockdown Interrupted Leona will be ordered to basic attack the target. Spell shield will block Zenith Blade's effects as well as preventing Leona from dashing to the last target hit. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Edit Solar Flare Solar Flare COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 90 / 75 / 60 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1200 EFFECT RADIUS: 325 / 175 / 800 INNER RADIUS: 100 Active: Leona calls down a solar flare that strikes upon the target location after 0. 625 seconds, granting sight of the area before impact and for another 3 seconds afterwards. Enemies hit are dealt magic damage . Magic Damage: 150 / 225 / 300 (+ 80% AP) Targets are also slowed by 80% for 1. 75 seconds, or stunned for the same duration if they are hit by the epicenter. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Solar Flare's visual effects are only visible to enemies if they have sight of the area it was cast upon. The cast indicator shows 300 radius for the area of effect and 120 radius for the epicenter, however the actual hitbox radii are larger than those values. The revealed radius is not obstructed by terrain or brush . Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins. For all associated collection items, see Leona (Collection) .

Magic's disappearance was retribution for humanity's arrogance and misuse of it. As a worshipper of the Prismae Crystals, she believes it's her sacred duty to protect them. But she also prays to them in secret, hoping they'll bring back her lost love, Diana, who disappeared after journeying to the north.

Sunlight and Illumination have nearly identical functionality, with the only differences being who (Leona's allies and Lux herself, respectively) and what (any allied damage source and Lux's basic attacks, respectively) triggers them. Sunlight deals 1 less damage to champions wearing sunglasses (whether by default like Vayne or through a skin like Riot Graves or Surfer Singed ). Leona is the modern feminine derivative of Ancient Greek name Leon Λέων " lion ", from an Afro-Asiatic source [2] (cf. Proto-Semitic *labuʔ ~ *labiʔ ); [3] Her title 'the Radiant Dawn' might be referencing Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn & Hausos , the PIE Dawn Goddess. A functional real-life replica of Leona's Zenith Blade was crafted in an episode of YouTube series Man At Arms: Reforged . This video can be viewed here . There are also episodes where they crafted: Diana's Crescent Moonblade ( functional ) Katarina's Daggers ( functional ) Master Yi's 'Highlander' Ring Sword ( functional ) Poppy's Hammer of Orlon ( functional ) Yasuo's 'Last Breath' Sword ( functional ) Ziggs' Hexplosive Bomb ( prop ) See also [ ] League of Legends Wiki | Champions Cancelled Champions Ao Shin Avasha Averdrian CeeCee Cyborg Cowboy Eagle Rider Gavid Husk Iron Engineer Ivan Omen Priscilla Rob Blackblade Seth Tabu Tiki Urf Well References [ ] ↑ Leona's profile page at LeagueOfLegends.com ↑ http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=%2fdata%2fsemham%2fafaset&text_number=2279&root=config ↑ The Semitic Languages .
