The human Nunu is used to visualize various abilities , and appears in emotes . He is not one distinct unit. Abilities [ ] Edit Call of the Freljord Call of the Freljord TARGET IMMUNITY : 10 TARGET RANGE: 1000 / 700 Innate: When Nunu and Willump deal damage against an enemy champion , large monster or structure , they and a nearby allied champion gain Call of the Freljord for 4 seconds, prioritizing the ally with highest attack speed . Call of the Freljord: Gain 20% bonus attack speed and 10% bonus movement speed . Willump's basic attacks additionally deal 30% AD physical damage to secondary targets in a cone in front of him. Nunu and Willump cannot trigger Call of the Freljord from the same enemy again for a time. Successive triggers of Call of the Freljord while it is active will extend the duration by 4 seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Default damage Physical The splash damage will critically strike when the basic attack does, but will not deal any bonus damage. Call of the Freljord range to be shared with allies is based on Nunu and Willump's location. If no ally is prioritized based on their stats, it will be given to the one closest to them. Enemies that can trigger Call of the Freljord have a marker overhead. This marker isn't present on inhibitors or the nexus (because they cannot hold buffs and debuffs including the one that hosts this VFX), but they still trigger Call of the Freljord when attacked. Call of the Freljord's maximum remaining duration is 44 seconds. The buff has no cap for its maximum total duration. Edit Consume Consume COST: 60 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 3 TARGET RANGE: 125 Active: Willump takes a bite out of the target enemy, dealing damage and healing himself. The heal is increased by 50% while he is below 50% maximum health . Against minions and monsters , he deals true damage . Additionally, if Consume would kill the target minion or small or medium monster, the target is stunned and pulled towards Willump over the cast time. Non-Champion True Damage: 400 / 600 / 800 / 1000 / 1200 Base Non-Champion Heal: 65 / 95 / 125 / 155 / 185 (+ 90% AP) (+ 10% bonus health) Empowered Non-Champion Heal: 97. 5 / 142. 5 / 187. 5 / 232. 5 / 277. 5 (+ 135% AP) (+ 15% bonus health) Against champions , he deals magic damage and the heal is reduced to 60%. Champion Magic Damage: 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 65% AP) (+ 5% bonus health) Base Champion Heal: 39 / 57 / 75 / 93 / 111 (+ 54% AP) (+ 6% bonus health) Empowered Champion Heal: 58. 5 / 99. 375 / 140. 25 / 181. 125 / 222 (+ 81% AP) (+ 9% bonus health) Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage True damage / Magic damage Counters Spell shield Blocked Icon border glows when he is within the maximum healing threshold. Spell shields will block the damage and the heal. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Edit Biggest Snowball Ever! Biggest Snowball Ever! COST: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana COOLDOWN : 14 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 750 − 1750 (based on charge time) SPEED: 350 Size Radius: 75 − 200 (based on charge time) Active: Willump cleanses himself from all slows and channels for up to 10 seconds, becoming ghosted and slow-immune and creating a rolling snowball . Willump automatically navigates his movement and can steer the snowball with a slow turn rate that increases over time, resetting upon changing direction. The duo have their movement speed reduced by 50% for the first 1 second, but after a delay they start gaining 14 movement speed every 0. 25 seconds, up to a cap . The snowball increases in size and power over 5 seconds. Biggest Snowball Ever! can be recast after 0. 5 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically after the channel or if interrupted . The snowball explodes upon hitting an enemy champion , large pet , medium / large monster or terrain, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies, increased by 0% − 400% (based on charge time) , knocking them up for 0. 5 − 0. 75 (based on charge time) seconds and subsequently stunning them for 0 − 0. 5 (based on charge time) seconds. Minimum Magic Damage: 36 / 45 / 54 / 63 / 72 (+ 30% AP) Maximum Magic Damage: 180 / 225 / 270 / 315 / 360 (+ 150% AP) The snowball rolls over enemy minions and small monsters hit, dealing 33. 3 % of the damage as magic damage . Minimum Reduced Damage: 11. 988 / 14. 985 / 17. 982 / 20. 979 / 23. 976 (+ 9. 99 % AP) Maximum Reduced Damage: 59. 94 / 74. 925 / 89. 91 / 104. 895 / 119. 88 (+ 49. 95 % AP) Recast: Willump releases the snowball, sending it rolling forward up to a maximum distance during which it will not grow any larger and will explode upon hitting an enemy. Link ▶️ "This is gonna be the biggest snowball ever!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded Blocked Not Blocked Disabled Disruption Interrupted The initial cast and the manual recast count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and Force Pulse . The movement speed reduction the duo receive from initially casting Biggest Snowball Ever! is not considered a slow , thus it will not be resisted by their slow immunity . There are 3 stages where the turn rate increases from the original one: After turning for 1 second, the turn rate is increased to 175%. After turning for 3 seconds, the turn rate is increased to 250%. After turning for 6 seconds, the turn rate is increased to 325% where it caps. The time threshold to begin gaining bonus movement speed may be bugged, as Flat Bonus MS increases the time while % Bonus MS decreases the time. The formula appears to be (X ÷ 100) - Y, where: X = Total Flat MS after caps Y = 0. 1 per 1% %MS The delay is not modified from its initially calculated value on-cast, even if additional movement speed is gained. Nunu and Willump keep all increases in movement speed at time of cast for the duration of the charge. Nunu and Willump's movement speed always increases in increments of ~14, reaching the greater value between 「 Total MS + 85 − 255 (based on level) 」 「 Total Uncapped Flat MS + 85 − 255 (based on level) 」 ( click to toggle ). This takes 6 increments to reach the Total MS + 85, but may take more to reach the Uncapped Flat + 85. Due to flat bonuses increasing the time threshold, it is possible for the ability's effects to end before reaching the total uncapped movement speed. The bonus movement speed ignores the movement speed cap . If Nunu turns continuously he will create a 600 unit circle, increased with bonus movement speed, striking the same point up to 3 times, for a maximum of 180 / 225 / 270 / 315 / 360 (+ 300% AP) magic damage . The damage can be further increased by detonating the snowball, for a total of 360 / 450 / 540 / 630 / 720 (+450% AP) magic damage . Ryze's Realm Warp will only teleport Nunu and Willump , leaving the snowball behind. Hovering the cursor on the HUD (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not affect the cast and steering of Biggest Snowball Ever! . Nunu gains a slightly larger field of view during Biggest Snowball Ever! . Biggest Snowball Ever! is disabled for the first 15 seconds of the game. Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun .

Magic Damage Per Hit: 16 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48 (+ 15% AP) Total Magic Damage: 48 / 72 / 96 / 120 / 144 (+ 45% AP) Enemies hit 3 times are slowed for 1 second. Champions and large monsters hit once are marked Snowbound for 4 seconds, refreshing on each hit. Snowball Barrage can be recast twice within 3 seconds at no additional cost and with a cooldown in between casts. Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Recast: Nunu hurls another volley of snowballs, mimicking the first cast's effects. An enemy may only be slowed once for being hit by snowballs. Maximum Total Magic Damage: 144 / 216 / 288 / 360 / 432 (+ 135% AP) After 3 seconds from the first cast, Snowbound enemies near Willump take magic damage and are rooted for 0. 5 − 1. 5 (based on level) seconds. Magic Damage: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 80% AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Each cast volley of snowballs counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive Each volley of snowballs is also a separate cast instance , allowing Snowball Barrage to trigger Phase Rush on its own or trigger 6 stacks of Conqueror . Snowbound consumption does not trigger on-cast effects, neither does it count as a separate cast instance (e.g. for the purposes of Conqueror ). The three snowballs are thrown independently from one another over the 0. 4 seconds and their direction is determined from Nunu & Willump's position at any given moment. Edit Absolute Zero Absolute Zero COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 110 / 100 / 90 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 650 Active: Nunu and Willump channel a blizzard for up to 3 seconds, granting themself a shield and slowing nearby enemies by 0% − 95% (based on channel time) . Shield Strength: 65 / 75 / 85 (+ 150% AP) (+ 30 / 40 / 50% bonus health) Absolute Zero can be recast after 0. 5 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically when the channel ends by any means. Recast: Nunu and Willump explode, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies, modified to 0% − 100% (based on channel time) . Affected enemies will remain slowed for 0 − 3 (based on channel time) seconds and any of the duo's remaining shield will decay over 3 seconds.

[2] Nunu is also a nickname for his wife. [3] The update in patch V7.16 that made it so the portrait of the selected skin would be used in the central portion of the in-game UI showed the portrait of Willump instead of Nunu for every skin except for his Original skin. Absolute Zero was named after the theoretical temperature at which matter stops moving completely (referencing both slows the ability has) and has the highest single ability power ratio in-game ( 300% ). In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called "Nunurf" , referencing Urf . The Boy and his Yeti Nunu & Willump drop a soul each. Their dance is an updated version of their old animation in which Willump dances and Nunu provides flute music. Willump was most likely inspired by several characters from different media, such as: Stitch from the Lilo & Stitch franchise, Wild Thing from Where the Wild Things Are series, Appa from Avatar: The Last Airbender series.
