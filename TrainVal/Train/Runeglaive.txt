This item was removed because not all AP junglers could actually use it effectively, since not all of them have synergy with Spellblade, or with auto-attacking to begin with. In addition, this item was known to cause serious balance issues, especially back when it used to convert the base auto attack into magic damage, allowing this item to be abused by solo laners that had synergy with Spellblade items. It was replaced by Runic Echoes , which is more useful for a wider variety of AP junglers, and it is not abused by solo laners. Icons Skirmisher's Sabre Stalker's Blade Tracker's Knife
