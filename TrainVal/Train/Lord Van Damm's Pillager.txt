Trivia Lord Van Damm's Pillager provided (before Patch 5.11 ) exactly the same stats and passive as Infinity Edge , with the only difference being its build path. This was done to allow building this item more easily on Twisted Treeline and Dominion . As of Patch 5.1 Infinity Edge has got its critical strike chance lowered to 20% from 25%. The item was named after a summoner from EU West as a Refer-A-Friend reward. This summoner was known as one of administrators of Russian fan-site lol-game.ru. Its name was also based on the Belgian Actor and Martial Artist Jean-Claude Van Damme. Ashes to Ashes references the phrase ashes to ashes, dust to dust .
