Zac's size also reduces based on his missing health , down to 70% total size while at 0% health . Innate - Goo: Whenever Zac damages at least one enemy with an ability , he sheds a number of chunks of himself to a nearby location, landing towards nearby visible enemy champions and lasting for 6 seconds. Stretching Strikes : 1 chunk for each strike hit (excluding the collision) on different targets, up to 2 Unstable Matter : 1 chunk if it hits at least one target Elastic Slingshot : 1 chunk for each enemy champion hit Let's Bounce! : 1 chunk for each bounce that hits an enemy champion, up to 4 Both Zac and enemy champions can interact with a chunk by being within 50 units of it: an enemy will destroy it, while Zac will consume it to heal for 5 / 6 / 7 / 8% (based on Let's Bounce!'s Rank) of his maximum health . Innate: Periodically, upon taking fatal damage , Zac enters resurrection for 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level) seconds and restores 50% of his maximum health , splitting into 4 uncontrollable Bloblets . Each bloblet has 12% of his maximum health and moves towards Zac's location over the duration. Any damage the bloblets receive, excluding damage dealt in excess of their total health , is also redirected to Zac in true damage . While in resurrection, Zac is untargetable and unable to act , and cannot take damage from sources other than the redirected damage from his bloblets . After the duration, Zac is revived with 10 - 50% maximum health . Zac will die once all bloblets are killed. See Pets for more details about bloblets. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive The damage directed to Zac is internal raw damage . The bloblets are untargetable while splitting, and will not split over terrain. Zac's increased size does not consider his base stats. Cell Division's chunks spawn in two versions: Contestable: They will fall to the ground at a point which is roughly equidistant from Zac and the nearest visble enemy champion within 1000 range of him (dropping slightly in Zac's favor). The location at which they fall to the ground is influenced by the direction in which Zac is currently facing. Cannot be interacted with for the first 0. 25 seconds (except during Let's Bounce! ). Uncontestable: They will fall to the ground near Zac and can be picked up immediately (version used by default). Zac's untargetability upon triggering Cell Division does not destroy in-flight projectiles . Chronoshift and Guardian Angel will take priority over Cell Division . Spirit Visage and Heal Power increases the healing of both chunks and bloblets . Ryze's Realm Warp is able to individually teleport Zac or his bloblets during Cell Division . If Zac is transported to a new location before the bloblets landed, they will travel to form at his new position, adjusting their speed accordingly. If Cell Division's duration permits during this time, Zac will be revived even if the bloblets fail to recombine. Cell Division's bloblets can be targeted by Teleport and Syndra's Force of Will . Other bloblets are not interrupted by the conditions above and will continue to recombine instinctively. Zac's health when the bloblets are sent out is set to what it would be if all bloblets recombined, and is actively updated when the bloblets take damage. If Zac's health is higher than it is supposed to be when the bloblets converge on him, his health will be set to the correct value. The following table refers for interactions while Zac is in resurrection: Attacking Disabled Abilities Disabled Movement Disabled Items Usable N/A Disabled All items are disabled Interrupted by N/A Consumables Disabled Spells Usable N/A Disabled Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Flash Teleport Recall Hexflash Mark Dash Interrupted by N/A Interrupted by Death Map-Specific Differences Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit Cooldown set to 60 seconds. Arena differences edit Bloblets are damaged by the Ring of Fire. Edit Stretching Strikes Stretching Strikes COST: 8% Current Health COOLDOWN : 14 / 12. 5 / 11 / 9. 5 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 951 WIDTH: 160 TETHER RADIUS: 1000 SPEED: 2800 Active: Zac stretches his left arm in the target direction that catches the first enemy hit, dealing magic damage , slowing them by 40% for 0. 5 seconds, and forming a tether between Zac and the target for 2 seconds, during which they are revealed . Magic Damage: 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 (+ 30% AP) (+ 4% of Zac's maximum health) Total Magic Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 60% AP) (+ 8% of Zac's maximum health) While the tether persists, Zac's next basic attack is replaced by a second Stretching Strike , empowering it to have a 0. 25 -second cast time and gain 25 bonus attack range . This attack cannot critically strike . If the two Stretching Strikes affect different targets, both are rooted for 0. 5 seconds and receive the same slow . After a 0. 4 -second delay , Zac displaces them toward each other over 300-units, though not through terrain. If the two targets are near each other, they are instead slammed together through the displacement, dealing the initial magic damage and knocking them up and stunning them for 0. 25 seconds upon impact. Surrounding enemies are also dealt the initial magic damage . Both Stretching Strikes (the cast and the empowered attack) reset Zac's basic attack timer. Zac is unable to move or attack while his left arm is in flight. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Blocked Blocked Blocked The following features were added in patch V7.10 to increase Stretching Strikes' reliability and usability: If the first attack's target is a minion, would die from the damage, and is above a certain amount of health, the minion is instead left at 1 health. The health threshold increases with Stretching Strikes' damage. If the second attack's target would die from the damage, it won't be dealt until they are slammed to the first target. Non-champion units that are affected by Stretching Strikes' displacement are prevented from taking any damage until they are slammed together. Note that this often confuses players who are trying to secure monsters via Smite while Zac is slamming the wanted target, resulting in Smite dealing no damage to it. It is currently unknown whatever the side effects of this feature are intentional or not. Spell shields will block a single instance of damage only. If the tethered target is untargetable during the second Stretching Strike via basic attack, they are completely unaffected by the ability. Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed.

Unstable Matter's current cooldown is reduced by 1 second whenever Zac collects a Cell Division chunk.

Maximum Range Channel Duration: 0. 9 / 1 / 1. 1 / 1. 2 / 1. 3 Elastic Slingshot can be recast within the duration. If Zac cancels the channel himself, or the charge completes without reactivation, 50% of Elastic Slingshot's health cost and cooldown are refunded. Recast: Zac leaps to the target location. Upon landing, he deals magic damage to nearby enemies and knocks them up and stuns them for 0. 5 seconds, increased to 1 second if Elastic Slingshot was charged for more than 1 second. Magic Damage: 60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 (+ 80% AP) Elastic Slingshot will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

Elastic Slingshot will not knock up if the targeted location was directly on top of Zac (in which case he will not dash at all). (bug) The knock up will occasionally end early if the targeted location was slightly away from Zac . (bug) Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun .

Each bounce deals magic damage to enemies hit, knocks them back over 1 second, and slows them by 20% for the same duration.

Original View in 3D 880 29.03.2013 Zac is the product of a toxic spill that ran through a chemtech seam and pooled in an isolated cavern deep in Zaun’s Sump. Despite such humble origins, Zac has grown from primordial ooze into a thinking being who dwells in the city’s pipes, occasionally emerging to help those who cannot help themselves or to rebuild the broken infrastructure of Zaun.

Zac made a cameo in Battle Bunny Riven's artwork and maybe even in the game's Mac Version trailer (all before he was released). Zac is the only champion that can be damaged by regular Smite (due to Cell Division's chunks being coded as minions) and to have 2 laugh animations. Let's Bounce! references Tigger from Winnie-the-Pooh by A. A. Milne . The pitch level of his voice changes based on how much health he currently has. Zac is one of the six champions who use health as a resource for their abilities, the other five being Briar , Dr. Mundo , Olaf , Soraka , and Vladimir .
