Old icons 1st version Trivia This crown belongs to Shurelya, a historian who studies Shuriman artifacts. This item is named after Miyuki 'Shurelia' Mitsuhashi , a former Associate Game Designer at Riot Games Inc. The decision to give this item a movement speed boost is due to an inside joke at Riot. Shurelia has a very high voice; therefore the co-workers joked that it was only so high due to the Doppler effect and that Shurelia moved so quickly. This item provides the second highest movement speed buff from an item when activated (10% less than Mercurial Scimitar ). The item's name is a reference to a Spell Card of Marisa Kirisame from Touhou , which is named " Stardust Reverie ".
