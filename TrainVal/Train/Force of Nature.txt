Strategy Force of Nature is an effective defense measure against magic damage dealers, especially against those who continuously apply the damage type. Force of Nature's effect can be stacked up very quickly against spells that both deal magic damage and apply an immobilizing effect, as well as against those that apply damage over time . Old icons 1st version 2nd version Trivia Force of Nature was the only item to provide movement speed , magic resistance , and health regeneration . The item was removed on Season Two because the stats it gave didn't synergize with each other, and it provided too much magic resistance in one item. The passive was given to Warmog's Armor and Spirit Visage was given more magic resist to serve as a different end-game MR item. [1] Ironically, it was reworked and re-added with near the same type of stats, except the health regen component, but instead gives better movement speed and survivality against magic damage.
