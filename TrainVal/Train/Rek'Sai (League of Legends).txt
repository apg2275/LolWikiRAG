After 8 seconds of being out of combat , she loses 20 Fury per second. Prey Seeker will not generate Fury against non- champions . When Rek'Sai becomes Burrowed , she consumes her current Fury over 3 seconds to heal for up to 10 (+ 2% − 10% (based on level) maximum health) at 100 Fury , stopping once fully consumed or she reaches full health . If she starts generating Fury while Burrowed , the consumption occurs after 5 seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Fury bar changes from Yellow to Red when full. When Rek'Sai automatically consumes Fury while Burrowed (no transformation), the healing buff will refresh every second while she has/maintains over 25 Fury . (bug) This causes the healing to last 6 seconds at 100 Fury . Edit Queen's Wrath Queen's Wrath COOLDOWN : 4 / 3. 5 / 3 / 2. 5 / 2 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 325 Active: Rek'Sai empowers her next three basic attacks within 3 seconds to have a 0. 25 -second cast time and deal bonus physical damage to the target and surrounding enemies. The damage to the primary target is affected by critical strike modifiers. Bonus Physical Damage: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% AD Total Bonus Physical Damage: 90 / 105 / 120 / 135 / 150% AD Queen's Wrath resets Rek'Sai's basic attack timer. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Physical Counters Parries Missing Damage to the primary target applies proc damage and damage to secondary targets applies default damage . Queen's Wrath's bonus damage applies against structures . Basic attacks refresh the duration of Queen's Wrath . There is a brief delay between each attack of Queen's Fury after the attack's cast time elapses. If Rek'Sai has more than 1. 4 attack speed , she can cancel this delay to perform the next attack quicker. This does not occur if she is attacking automatically . Queen's Wrath's enhanced attacks still apply on-hit and on-attack effects and life steal to the primary target. When dodged , the damage dealt to the primary target is nullified; however, damage to any secondary targets still occurs. PENDING FOR TEST: : Queen's Wrath interactions with blocking and blinding effects. If the primary target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270. Bonus AD ratio changed to 70% bonus AD . AP ratio changed to 130% AP . Edit Burrow Burrow COOLDOWN : 4 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 1500 Active: Rek'Sai becomes Burrowed , reducing her attack range to 75 and her sight radius to 250 units while gaining access to her Burrowed abilities. She also becomes ghosted and gains 5 / 10 / 15 (based on level) bonus movement speed , as well as Tremor Sense . Tremor Sense: Rek'Sai and her allies gain obscured vision of nearby enemy units that are moving every second. Once Burrow has been learned, Rek'Sai automatically becomes Burrowed upon completing a Recall channel or respawning . Link ▶️ Champion detection alert. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Burrow does not count as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Enemies detected by Tremor Sense are displayed as rings on the ground. Champions display larger rings and Rek'Sai will react to this detection. Visible enemies will not be detected by Tremor Sense. Enemies standing still while Rek'Sai is nearby are insensible by Tremor Sense . Rek'Sai sensing a nearby enemy with Tremor Sense . Edit Furious Bite Furious Bite COOLDOWN : 12 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 225 Active: Rek'Sai bites the target enemy, dealing physical damage . Physical Damage: 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 (+ 70% AD) At maximum Fury , Furious Bite's damage is doubled and converted to true damage . True Damage: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+ 140% AD) Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Physical damage / True damage Drawn Counters Spell shield Blocked If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Edit Prey Seeker Prey Seeker COOLDOWN : 12 / 11. 5 / 11 / 10. 5 / 10 CAST TIME: 0. 1 TARGET RANGE: 1500 EFFECT RADIUS: 150 WIDTH: 130 SPEED: 1950 Active: Rek'Sai fires a void bolt in the target direction that detonates on the first enemy hit, dealing physical damage to all nearby enemies and revealing them for 5 seconds. Physical Damage: 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+ 50% bonus AD) (+ 70% AP) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Prey Seeker's effect radius is centered around the location of the missile as it collides. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270. Bonus AD ratio changed to 70% bonus AD . AP ratio changed to 130% AP . Edit Unburrow Unburrow CAST TIME: none STATIC COOLDOWN : 1 TARGET IMMUNITY : 10 EFFECT RADIUS: 220 / 75 / 250 Active: Rek'Sai becomes Un-Burrowed , gaining access to her Un-Burrowed abilities. Additionally, she deals physical damage to nearby enemies and knocks them aside , then slows them by 40% for 0. 5 seconds. The enemy closest to the center is instead knocked up for 1 second, and cannot be affected by Unburrow again for some time. Physical Damage: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 80% bonus AD) Rek'Sai can also trigger Unburrow by issuing an attack command, applying the knock up against the target once she is in attack range. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Blocked Rek'Sai's attack range is reduced by 50 while Burrowed , which makes an automatic cast of Unburrow always put Rek'Sai at least 50 units within her attack range against the target to follow up with. Note that the Unborrow effect radius is usually greater than 75, meaning Rek'Sai can knock up a single target from slightly further away when she casts Unburrow the standard way, but may have to walk slightly closer to attack that target afterwards. The slow debuff is applied when the airborne debuff is removed and lasts until the first buff update after its duration completes ("is fuzzy"). Unburrow does not count as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Unburrow's per-target cooldown only applies to targets affected by the knock-up , but provides immunity to all effects of the ability. Unburrow is still considered an ability and is thus stopped by silence . She can basic attack normally during this time, without leaving unburrow . For a brief moment during the beginning animation of Tunnel , Rek'Sai can trigger Unburrow by issuing an attack command. Edit Tunnel Tunnel COOLDOWN : 26 / 24 / 22 / 20 / 18 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 850 On-Tunnel Cooldown : 10 / 8 / 6 / 4 / 2 Active: Rek'Sai dashes in the target direction, leaving behind a Tunnel with two interconnected entrances that lasts up to 10 minutes. The Tunnel can be traversed again when Rek'Sai targets either entrance, shutting down the Tunnel for a few seconds. Rek'Sai can have up to 8 Tunnels active on the map at once, but deploying beyond the maximum destroys the oldest one. Enemy champions can destroy a Tunnel by standing on either entrance for 1. 5 seconds, granting them 5 upon successfully destroying the Tunnel . An Un-Burrowed Rek'Sai will automatically Burrow before entering the Tunnel and automatically Unburrow after exiting it. This does not put Burrow on cooldown nor trigger Fury of the Xer'Sai , but does trigger other Burrow effects and Unburrow . Rek'Sai cannot enter a tunnel while immobilized , grounded , or silenced . Hide Details Tips & Tricks Info Targeting input Direction Insufficient dash range Dash will gain bonus range through terrain. Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted Creating a Tunnel grants sight of the area at the other end for 2 seconds. Tunnel entrances can be targeted by allied movement abilities (ex: Leap Strike , Shunpo , Safeguard , Teleport ). Tunnel entrances are visible on allied champions' minimaps, while enemies must first gain sight of one before it becomes visible on theirs (the opposite entrance is not revealed). Destroying a Tunnel while Rek'Sai is traversing it will not prevent her from reaching the opposite entrance. Rek'Sai can Tunnel through terrain if she dashes close to them and the wall is thin enough to allow the opposite entrance to spawn on the other side. If Rek'Sai issues an attack command while the dash passes by an enemy, the target will be knocked up but Rek'Sai will still complete the movement. Tips & Tricks Enemies can block Rek'Sai from using a tunnel entrance if a ward is placed directly over it, because the cursor's target selection prioritizes wards over tunnel entrances. Rek'Sai will take longer to enter a Tunnel from Un-Burrowed state because she needs to become Burrowed . Edit Void Rush Void Rush COOLDOWN: 100 / 90 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1500 SPEED: 1400 Passive: Rek'Sai applies Marked as Prey to enemy champions she damages, lasting for 5 seconds. Active: Rek'Sai selects the target Marked as Prey , becoming displacement immune and unable to act and vanishing into the ground. After 1. 5 seconds, she becomes targetable again and emerges from the ground Un-Burrowed near the target and pounces at them, dealing physical damage and dashing 125 units through them. Physical Damage: 100 / 250 / 400 (+ 175% bonus AD) (+ 20 / 25 / 30% of target's missing health) If the target dies or is too far away before Rek'Sai vanishes, Void Rush is canceled with a 10-second cooldown. Link ▶️ Activation alert. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Not Interrupted Rek'Sai will track the target if they change locations. She will dash through the target's previous location without dealing damage if the target is too far away or moves beyond 1750 units. The damage can be dodged if the target moves 1000 or more units away. All sources of damage by Rek'Sai count for applying the mark. Void Rush has a brief cast time during which Rek'Sai is still targetable. Void Rush's displacement immunity begins from the start of the cast time, and ends when the dash ends. Void Rush's damage can be dodged by becoming untargetable . Rek'Sai can activate Void Rush while Burrowed or Unburrowed . She will always emerge as Unburrowed . If Rek'Sai enters resurrection during the cast time, Void Rush is canceled and goes on a 10 second cooldown. If the resurrection occurs while vanished , she will emerge and pounce the target immediately. A screeching noise made by Rek'Sai can be heard globally after Void Rush is cast ( will be heard by enemies even if they don't have sight of Rek'Sai and/or her destination ).

Original View in 3D 880 11.12.2014 An apex predator, Rek’Sai is a merciless Void-spawn that tunnels beneath the ground to ambush and devour unsuspecting prey. Her insatiable hunger has laid waste to entire regions of the once-great empire of Shurima—merchants, traders, even armed caravans, will go hundreds of miles out of their way to avoid her and her offspring’s hunting grounds. All know that once Rek’Sai is seen on the horizon, death from below is all but guaranteed.

Rek'Sai is the first fighter champion released without a secondary role. Rek'Sai's design was greatly influenced [2] by the canceled champion Omen . Just like with Cho'Gath , Malphite , Nautilus , and Skarner , Rek'Sai's in-game size is smaller than in-universe (she is estimated to be as large as a 'small T. rex , mammoth , whale shark , large but not huge'). Rek'Sai had her game assets reused for several featured game modes . She was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Grumpy Burrow Monster" (along with its huge variant) in Invasion . Her animations were reused for the Anchortail , Brightcore , and Rhinodon monsters in Odyssey: Extraction .
