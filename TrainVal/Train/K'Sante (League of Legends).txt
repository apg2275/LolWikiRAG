Physical Damage: 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 (+ 40% AD) (+ 30% bonus armor) (+ 30% bonus magic resistance) If this hits at least one enemy, K'Sante generates a stack for 6 seconds, stacking up to 2 times and refreshing on subsequent hits. At 2 stacks, the next Ntofo Strikes consumes them all to become empowered with a new effect. Empowered Active: K'Sante fires a shockwave in the target direction that applies the same effects to enemies hit, but also pulls them towards him over 0. 65 seconds and then stuns them for 0. 25 seconds.

During this time, he gains displacement immunity and 40% − 65% (based on level) damage reduction. Path Maker can be recast within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards. Path Maker's charge cannot be interrupted by crowd control . Recast: K'Sante dashes in the target direction, though not through terrain, dealing physical damage to enemies he passes through, carrying them alongside him, and stunning them for 1. 25 seconds. This damage is capped at 50 − 475 (based on level) against monsters . Physical Damage: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+ 50% AD) (+ 50% bonus armor) (+ 50% bonus magic resistance) (+ 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10% of target's maximum health) All Out Bonus: Path Maker no longer applies its knock back and stun , but its damage reduction is increased to 50% − 75% (based on level) , charge time for the minimum duration and maximum dash range is reduced to 0. 45 seconds, and total cooldown is reduced, as well as has increased dash speed. Upon entering All Out , Path Maker's cooldown is refreshed. Ntofo Strikes and All Out can be cast during the dash. Path Maker's recast can be used while affected by cast-inhibiting crowd control . Hide Details Tips & Tricks Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked See Notes Interrupted Disruption Not Interrupted All Out's duration is increased by 2 seconds if it were to expire during Path Maker's charge. Path Maker cancels any existing movement or attack commands. However, new inputs given during the charge will be retained once the dash ends, except when the dash hits only one enemy champion. If Path Maker hits only one enemy champion K'Sante will be ordered to basic attack them afterwards. If K'Sante blinks during the charge, the dash is interrupted but any enemies at his blink point will be affected by Path Maker's effects only if they were within the maximum charged distance. Enemies outside the charge range cannot be hit this way. Targets hit are knocked back in the original target direction of Path Maker . The displacement distance is longer than intended. (bug) K'Sante cannot use Flash during Path Maker's dash. Path Maker's damage is not capped against monsters while empowered by All Out . (bug) Path Maker's recast can be used even while grounded or rooted . Path Maker can be recast by issuing an attack move command (or LMB ) but not a targeted attack command. The following table refers for interactions while K'Sante is channeling : If the charge is cancelled, he will not automatically use the recast.

Due to the scaling of the charged effects, Path Maker is often cast farther than the minimum distance even when attempting a very short charge.

Footwork can be cast on allies to dash to them at an increased range and speed. If the ally is a champion upon arrival, they receive the shield as well. Shield Strength: 50 / 90 / 130 / 170 / 210 (+ 10% bonus health) All Out Bonus: Footwork's dash speed and location range are increased, and it can dash through terrain. Footwork resets K'Sante's basic attack timer. K'Sante can cast any of his abilities during the dash. Footwork will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Location Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted The basic attack reset is not considered one for Hail of Blades .

Edit All Out All Out COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 4 TARGET RANGE: 300 EFFECT RADIUS: 5000 / Global SPEED: 2000 Active: K'Sante roots the target enemy champion for 0. 5 seconds and gains displacement immunity over the cast time, then shatters his ntofos to knock them back , during which they are revealed , and blinks to the end location. The target is dealt magic damage near the end of the displacement and is stunned for 0. 25 seconds afterwards. Magic Damage: 70 / 110 / 150 (+ 65% AP) If the target hits terrain during the displacement, they are knocked back through the terrain and dealt the magic damage once they emerge. At the end of the displacement, they remain airborne for 0. 5 seconds and K'Sante strikes them to deal additional magic damage , after which they are stunned for 0. 25 seconds. Additional Damage: 70 / 110 / 150 (+ 65% AP) Total Magic Damage: 140 / 220 / 300 (+ 130% AP) After K'Sante blinks , he enters All Out for 20 seconds, and the ability can be recast after 1. 5 seconds within the duration. All Out: K'Sante gains a health threshold equal to 65% maximum health which cannot be modified nor exceeded by any means. Upon entering All Out , his current health is reduced to this threshold. Additionally, his base armor and base magic resistance are reduced by 85% bonus armor and 85% bonus magic resistance , respectively. In return, he gains bonus attack damage and bonus attack speed , heals for a percentage of the post-mitigation damage dealt to enemy champions, and modifies his basic abilities which can be cast at no cost. Bonus Attack Damage: 10 / 25 / 40 (+ 25% bonus armor) (+ 25% bonus magic resistance) Bonus Attack Speed: 25 / 35 / 45% Healing Percentage: 10 / 15 / 20% Recast: K'Sante ends All Out early. K'Sante retains his maximum health and bonus resistances during All Out. Health lost from gaining the health threshold is not restored after the effect ends. Upon entering All Out, K'Sante is restored to 100% maximum mana which rapidly decays over the duration. His mana percentage prior to All Out is preserved and is gained back after the effect ends. If the target is knocked over terrain that is longer than 2000 units, K'Sante will vanish during their displacement and reappear near the end of it. Link ▶️ "I will not yield!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Blocked Disabled K'Sante will blink 175 units beyond the target's hitbox's edge at the end location. Going All Out does not override K'Sante's attack or movement commands if the target does not collide with terrain. If the target is however knocked back through terrain then K'Sante will be ordered to attack the target after appearing at the target's location. In addition to being knocked back, the target is also attached to a missile that travels in the same trajectory as the displacement. Removing the airborne does not cause the target to detach from the missile. All Out's knock back does not interact with player-generated terrain . Since K'Sante retains the stats he "lost", any effects that scale based on those stats will calculate based on the value prior to him going All Out . His base resistances can be reduced below 0 by his bonus resistances. Minimum knock back distance has distance of 300 units. Wall scan has distance of 350 units. K'Sante places enemy in distance of 450 units away from a wall and himself 550 units. Gaining bonus health during All Out causes the health threshold to be briefly increased then reset back to its original value. The bonus health is still applied to his current health. Bonus AD will not be affected by any changes in resistances. (bug) If the target resists the knockback, K'Sante will still blink behind the target's endpoint as if they were displaced. All Out's remaining duration is tracked in his secondary resource bar. His current mana will decay over the duration in order to indicate this. Once the effect ends, he will restore the mana he had prior to going All Out . K'Sante will blink closer to his target if there is no valid space at the end of the target's displacement. If the target dies during All Out's cast time, their camera will be locked in a position relative to them. (bug) If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

At 2 stacks, the next Ntofo Strikes consumes them all to become empowered with a new effect.

Footwork (E) Active: K'Sante dashes to the target location, though not through terrain, and grants himself a shield for 45 / 65 / 85 / 105 / 125 (+ 15% bonus health) for 2 seconds. Footwork can be cast on allies to dash to them at an increased range. If the ally is a champion upon arrival, they receive the shield as well. All Out Bonus: Footwork's dash speed and location range are increased, and it can dash through terrain. K'Sante can cast any of his abilities during the dash.

The target is dealt 35 / 70 / 105 (+ 20% AD) physical damage near the end of the displacement and is stunned for 0. 25 seconds afterwards. If the target collides with terrain during the displacement, they are knocked back through the terrain and are dealt the physical damage once they have gone past it.

After K'Sante blinks , he goes All Out for 20 seconds, and the ability can be recast after 1. 5 seconds within the duration. All Out: K'Sante's current health is reduced to 55% maximum health and he cannot exceed this threshold through healing nor health regeneration . Additionally, his base armor and base magic resistance are reduced by 65% bonus armor and 65% bonus magic resistance , respectively. In return, he gains 5 (+ 32. 5 % bonus armor) (+ 32. 5 % bonus magic resistance) bonus attack damage and 10% (+ 0. 75 % per 100 bonus health) omnivamp and empowers his basic abilities, which can be cast at no cost. Recast: K'Sante ends All Out early. K'Sante retains his maximum health and bonus resistances during All Out. Health lost from All Out is not restored after the effect ends. Upon going All Out, K'Sante is restored to 100% maximum mana which rapidly decays over the duration. His mana percentage prior to All Out is preserved and is gained back after the effect ends. If the target is knocked over terrain that is longer than 2000 units, K'Sante will vanish during their displacement and reappear near the end of it. Mana Cost: 100. Cooldown: 120 / 100 / 80 seconds.
