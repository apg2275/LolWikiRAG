This is about League of Legends Monsters. For other uses of Monster , see Monster (disambiguation) Several monsters from Summoner's Rift Monsters are neutral units in League of Legends . Unlike minions , monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (the exception of this being the Rift Scuttler , which simply runs away when attacked).

When attacked, the monster will move towards and attack the nearest champion who recently dealt damage to it, up to a certain distance from its spawning point (its "leash" distance). If the monster is unable to attack any target (such as if their current target goes untargetable or enters stealth ) or moves outside of its leash range, their "patience" bar depletes. This bar depletes faster the farther you are from the monster's spawn spot and the less you attack them after having provoked them. Non-epic monsters' patience will also deplete once they change targets. They can change it up to 6 times after which the patience bar reaches 0. When a monster is depleted of its patience, it will soft reset for 6 seconds. While in the process of soft resetting , the monster will path towards the center of its camp, heal for 6% of its maximum health every second, and ignore attackers outside of its leash range. Attacking a monster while it is within its leash range ends this soft reset prematurely to restore some of its patience and prevents it from being lost for 1. 5 seconds. If the soft reset ends from after 6 seconds, the monster will hard reset and in the process will ignore all attackers, rapidly heal, and path to its original position. Once it arrives back at their camp, they will recover their patience after 2 seconds of their arrival. Notes While resetting, a monster will move slower during a soft reset and move faster during a hard reset . Small monsters match the patience of their respective large monster as long as it is alive and within 700 units. Once a monster becomes provoked, they will detect champions even if they are not visible to them. This detection causes them to target the closest nearby champion up to their leash range. A monster that can see a champion provides vision of them to all of the other monsters in their camp. When the large monster of a camp dies, all other smaller monsters in their camp will be marked for death for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds of not being in combat with a champion, the marked monsters will die. Not all monsters have the same range type. The following monsters are melee : Ancient Krug , Krugs , and Mini Krugs Blue Sentinel Greater Murk Wolf and Murk Wolves Raptor Red Brambleback Rift Herald Voidmite The following monsters are ranged : Baron Nashor Crimson Raptor Dragons ( ) Gromp Rift Scuttler (does not attack when provoked but is technically ranged) Voidgrub Camp respawn [ ] After a camp has been completely cleared, it will remain empty for an amount of time specific to that camp (its "respawn time"), then all of the monsters will reappear. A camp's respawn timer can be known by pressing TAB. However, there is a prerequisite of having you or an allied champion witness the camp when it was cleared, or else the respawn timer remains unknown. This prevents the opposing team from knowing when a camp has been cleared and when it will respawn. A monster camp will not respawn until all of the monsters in the camp have been slain. For example, if the Greater Murk Wolf has been slain, but at least one of its two Murk Wolf companions has not, the camp's respawn timer will not start until the last Wolf has been slain. Monster Rewards [ ] As a general rule, killing a monster rewards its killer with gold and experience points. Killing a large monster without a jungle item ( Gustwalker Hatchling , Mosstomper Seedling , or Scorchclaw Pup ) reduces its bounty by 15 and its experience by 15 , modified to 12 when killing the Ancient Krug . Additionally, certain large monsters offer greater rewards when killed, such as an individual buff , a team buff, or a global gold reward. The Crest of Insight and Crest of Cinders buffs are gained respectively from the Blue Sentinel and the Red Brambleback , and may be transferred to another champion. This occurs when a champion kills someone holding a crest, causing the crest to be transferred to the killer and resetting the buffs duration. Either buff disappears entirely if the champion holding the crest is executed by a minion, monster, or tower, or when the crest simply wear offs on its own after a few minutes. The Eye of the Herald buff can be picked up by the team that delivered the killing blow to the Rift Herald , lasting for 4 minutes. This buff allows the holder to summon the Rift Herald on their team, which will then head to the closest lane to assist in pushing the lane until it dies. The stacking Dragon Slayer buffs acquired for slaying the Dragon are applied to all team members, whether living or dead, and last indefinitely. The exception to this is the Aspect of the Dragon from the Elder Dragon , which is only granted to living teammates and lasts for a few minutes and is lost upon death. The Touch of the Void buff is granted to all teammates when a Voidgrub is slain. The buff stacks for each grub killed. At 5 or 6 stacks of this buff, it also grants the Hunger of the Void . The Hand of Baron buff is only granted to living teammates when Baron Nashor is killed. The buff lasts for a few minutes and is lost upon death. Monsters will level up after having been killed, except Dragon , Rift Herald , and Baron Nashor . The monsters spawn at level 1 (6 for Dragon and Rift Herald ) in Summoner's Rift . Monster experience reward [ ] While owning a jungle item ( Gustwalker Hatchling , Mosstomper Seedling , or Scorchclaw Pup ), gain 80 bonus experience from killing large monsters. Your first monster kill grants 150 bonus experience .

The large amount of concentrated magic has mutated the local wildlife. From giant frogs , Giant Birds to Two-headed Wolves it has also attracted the attention of powerful Dragons who currently reside in one of the battle torn ruins. Sentinels , Bramblebacks and Krugs are creatures made from local flora and earth infused to construct a magical being. The Rift's unstable magic has inadvertently cause the reemergence of Baron Nashor , a large Serpent/Worm largely believed to be dead for centuries. It has his corruption affecting the land around him. Twisted Treeline [ ] After the fall of the Shadow Isles, the islands inhabitants were changed by the Black Mist . Numerous individuals and creatures now serve the Harrowing 's will. Vilemaw is an ancient spider of unknown origin currently residing in the cursed forest. The "Cult of the Spider" has most of its followers located in Noxus and Demacia . Elise serves as its High Priestess, traveling to and from between the two nations and the Shadow Isles , bringing her followers to live with the Spider God, Vilemaw, for eternity, or so they believe. Bilgewater [ ] Various monsters from across Runeterra, such as the Ironbacks , Ocklepods , Plundercrabs , and Razorfins are shipped through the black market and used for monster brawls .

While in the process of soft resetting , the monster will path towards the center of its camp, heal for 6% of its maximum health every second, and ignore attackers outside of its leash range. Attacking a monster while it is within its leash range ends this soft reset prematurely to restore some of its patience and prevents it from being lost for 1. 5 seconds. If the soft reset ends from after 6 seconds, the monster will hard reset and in the process will ignore all attackers, rapidly heal, and path to its original position. Monsters move slow while soft resetting and much more faster while hard resetting . New Effect: Monsters now regenerate patience that they have lost after 2 seconds of being back within their leash range. New Effect: Small monsters now match the patience of their respective large monster as long as it is alive and within 700 units. New Effect: When the large monster of a camp dies, all other smaller monsters in their camp will be marked for death for 10 seconds.

Monsters will get a temporary increase to their regeneration rate if they lose all their patience and retreat back to camp. V5.19 Jungle monsters now have a Patience characteristic. Monsters no longer reset their aggression based on distance or positioning - Instead, once the monster's Patience is reduced to zero, the monster will reset and return to their original position. During this reset, they rapidly regenerate health and do not respond to further aggression. Monsters lose Patience under the following conditions: When a monster is in an aggressive state but can't find any targets to attack (ex. its target died or became untargetable) When a monster's target is too far away from the monster's initial spawn location or the monster is VERY far away from its initial spawn location When the monster is forced to switch targets Large monsters display their Patience in a meter above their heads. Once a monster has recovered to 90% health, they regain all of their Patience .
