Once, he was his empire’s most esteemed warrior, leading the nation’s armies to countless victories. However, after the empire’s fall, Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with finding and killing his brother, Nasus, who he blames, in his madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.

Shortages and heightened demand led to online scalping, parents fist fighting in store aisles, and a small number of what police later described as “mall stampedes.” Patrick Seitz Pan Chengwei Toy Box Loot eligible Chromas Renektoy Chromas Amethyst Aquamarine Catseye Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Tanzanite Hextech View in 3D Special 20.12.2018 As is so often the way, artificers of the Hextech Renaissance pushed too far and too fast into their new science, without fully considering the possible consequences. Renekton—a half-mad monster of flesh and metal—is the result of that shortsightedness. Patrick Seitz Alvin Lee Hextech Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Blackfrost View in 3D 1350 05.03.2020 In life, Renekton stood against the tyranny of the Ice Witch, fighting an inevitable, endless winter until his last breath. In death, the virtuous warrior was cursed with resurrection—brought back to life as a vicious warmonger cased in rock and ice. Now a general leading the onslaught of the Black Frost army, Renekton loyally serves the very queen he once thought to destroy.

Kog'Maw and pre- voice update Lucian are also voiced by the same voice actor. Renekton's title used to be 'the Eater of Souls' (was changed to the current one after his sneak peek). In Legends of Runeterra , he clarifies himself as a crocodile, and not an alligator. When he closes his jaw you can see his upper and lower teeth, alligators would only show top teeth due to a strong overbite. Crocodiles are much more aggressive than alligators, and Renekton has a literal rage meter. [2] Cull the Meek used to be called 'Tyrant's Reach' (was changed for unknown reasons when his Champion Spotlight was released). Renekton's Art Spotlight is the only one not to show his Classic skin (shows Outback instead). Renekton - Nasus is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being Cassiopeia - Katarina , Kayle - Morgana , Garen - Lux , Yasuo - Yone , Darius - Draven , and Vi - Jinx ). Though not a pair, Anivia , Ornn , and Volibear are also siblings. Slice and Dice reference the eponymous expression. The motion Renekton performs when using the abilities references the 'death roll' . Slice's original icon resembles Ace in the Hole's . Dominus comes from the Roman title , from domus "home, house", thus " Household's Master " (cf. Greek despotes , Despoina , & Demeter ). Dominus and Fury of the Sands both granting almost the same effects references Renekton and Nasus ' brotherhood.
