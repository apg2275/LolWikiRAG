V1.0.0.79 Ezreal (1) Ezreal (2) Gangplank Fiddlesticks Tryndamere Ezreal, the Prodigal Explorer Release Date (US) March 16, 2010 Highlights New champion: Ezreal Remake: Twisted Fate New framerate normalization Related links Release Notes v1.0.0.79 & PVP.net v1.06.19 Patch chronology ← Previous Next → V1.0.0.75 V1.0.0.81 Contents 1 New Skins in the Store 2 Important Keybinding Change 3 New Framerate Normalization Settings 4 PVP.net v1.07.13 5 League of Legends v1.0.0.79 5.1 Champions 5.2 Items 5.3 General 6 References New Skins in the Store Spooky Gangplank Spectral Fiddlesticks Highland Tryndamere Nottingham Ezreal Important Keybinding Change The Level up spell hotkey has been changed to holding down Ctrl + pressing the spell hotkey. It is no longer Alt. This can be changed in the keybinding menu. Holding down Alt and pressing a spell hotkey will now cast the spell on yourself if it is self-castable, or cast the spell under your mouse cursor if applicable. This is referred to as "Smart Casting" and can be rebound in the key binding menu. New Framerate Normalization Settings There's a new video option available to players called "Frame Rate Cap." This allows players who experience unexpected drops in framerate to attempt to smooth out the performance. By default, the option is set to "Benchmark" which means that the framerate smoothing is disabled, and the game will run normally. The different settings have the following behaviors: Benchmark – this option makes the game run at its unaltered state with smoothing technology turned off. Stable – this attempt to detect and maintain a stable framerate above 25 FPS (frames per second). Players may experience a slightly lower maximum framerate, but fluctuations should be smaller. High Framerate – this option also detects the low and high framerates and attempts to normalize the performance, but at a higher rate than the "Stable" option. 25/30/60/80 – this option allows the player to control the target framerate the smoothing process will attempt to achieve. Note: These modes are still being tweaked and evaluated as we attempt to improve the framerate of the game. Different settings may produce different results for different CPU, video card and driver configurations. PVP.net v1.07.13 Improved the profanity filter in PVP.net as well as added an in-game filter. Both of these use whole word filtering instead of partial word filtering. There is now a shared option in PVP.net that will enable / disable the filter for both PVP.net and the game. Optimized matchmaking slightly to reduce queue times and prevent issues for users exiting the queue under certain conditions. Fixed an issue where it was possible to be left behind when an arranged team joins the queue. Fixed an issue with Logout that was keeping chat logged in, causing you to still appear online to friends. Fixed an issue that was causing some games to go to the "Skip Waiting for Stats" screen when someone would leave after the countdown timer hit zero. Fixed a few issues where the Leaver Buster's queue dodging messaging was being displayed incorrectly. Fixed an issue that was occasionally causing a delay when fulfilling purchases from the store to an inventory. Fixed an issue that was causing presence inaccuracies for friends in an Arranged Team. Fixed an issue where some friends would show up as offline, but were still able to chat. Fixed an issue that would cause remaining team members to not be able to requeue, if one member of the team had just queue dodged. Fixed an issue where logging out and back in with a different account would cause invites to come from the first account. Fixed an issue where the "Cancel" button wasn't always removing players from the queue. Fixed an issue that was causing tooltips to be truncated when the Friends List was undocked from PVP.net. Fixed an issue where if you had chat rooms on auto-join, you sometimes would not see all of your friends online when first logging in. Fixed an issue where the doors in the arranged team lobby sometimes would not open. Fixed an issue where if you logged out or exited PVP.net while in queue, it would not always correctly remove you from the queue.
