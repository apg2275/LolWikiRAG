Similar items Seeker's Armguard Verdant Barrier Steel Sigil Phage Tunneler Notes Hexdrinker's passive interacts with itself, similar to Thornmail . Given the lowest amount of magic resistance possible with this item (30 + 35 = 65), then the damage taken calculation (100 ÷ 165 = 0. 606 ), then the raw damage conversion ([110~280] ÷ 0. 606 ), the shield will absorb around 182 to 462 raw magic damage. Lifeline will still trigger if damage is taken while below 30% of maximum health. Nullifying Orb will always trigger before Lifeline when taking magic damage. Strategy Hexdrinker's shield can help its wielder fight through otherwise lethal magic damage. This may take opponents by surprise, especially if the opponent tries for a risky burst kill but fails to destroy the shield . Hexdrinker's short shield duration challenges users to make the most of the moment. Try relying on the shield to see you through enough magic damage to ensure your own kill, or to make a grand escape.
