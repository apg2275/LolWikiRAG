If Shen affects at least one other champion with an ability, Ki Barrier's cooldown is reduced by 4 − 7. 5 (based on level) seconds. Shen manifests a Spirit Blade that he can control with Twilight Assault and Spirit's Refuge . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive The Spirit Blade spawns with Shen , teleports closer to him if he gets too far away, and instantly blinks to him if he uses any global blink ( Teleport , Recall , or Stand United ). It will also dissappear if Shen dies and reappear upon respawning . Enemies see an arrow pointing from Shen to the location of his Spirit Blade even if it is not visible. Twilight Assault will grant the shield if the Spirit Blade reaches Shen . If it is stopped, no shield is granted. It will grant the cooldown reduction upon hitting an enemy champion. Spirit's Refuge will grant the shield and/or the cooldown reduction after the protective zone disappears. It does not need to block attacks to trigger the cooldown reduction, just touch an ally champion at any point of the duration. Shadow Dash will grant the shield when the dash ends. It will grant the cooldown reduction upon hitting an enemy champion. If the dash is interrupted , the shield will instead be received the moment the crowd control source is applied, before damage calculation (if any). Stand United will give the shield and/or the cooldown reduction upon completing the channel. Edit Twilight Assault Twilight Assault COST: 140 / 130 / 120 / 110 / 100 energy COOLDOWN : 8 / 7. 25 / 6. 5 / 5. 75 / 5 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: Global WIDTH: 160 SPEED: 2000 - 5000 Active: Shen recalls his Spirit Blade to his location. Enemy champions hit are slowed for the next 2 seconds while moving away from Shen . Slow: 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35% Once it arrives, Shen empowers his next 3 basic attacks within 8 seconds to gain 75 bonus range and deal bonus magic damage . Bonus Magic Damage: 10 − 40 (based on level) (+ 2 / 2. 5 / 3 / 3. 5 / 4% (+ 1. 5 % per 100 AP) of target's maximum health) Total Magic Damage: 30 − 120 (based on level) (+ 6 / 7. 5 / 9 / 10. 5 / 12% (+ 4. 5 % per 100 AP) of target's maximum health) If the Spirit Blade hit at least one enemy champion during the travel, the empowerment is enhanced to deal increased bonus magic damage and additionally grant Shen 50% bonus attack speed . Increased Bonus Damage: 10 − 40 (based on level) (+ 4 / 4. 5 / 5 / 5. 5 / 6% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health) Total Increased Damage: 30 − 120 (based on level) (+ 12 / 13. 5 / 15 / 16. 5 / 18% (+ 6% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health) Empowered attacks against monsters deal 100% bonus damage, but their total damage is capped. Maximum Monster Damage: 120 / 140 / 160 / 180 / 200 Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Blocked Blocked See Notes The Spirit Blade will stop in place upon colliding with Wind Wall or Unbreakable . If this occurs, Shen will not receive the empowered attacks. When it is called, the Spirit Blade also checks for units which's gameplay radius it overlaps which (equal to a 0 radius check) before flying off, allowing it to hit enemies whose center is behind the missile origin. The empowered attack will not trigger against structures nor wards . Edit Spirit's Refuge Spirit's Refuge COST: 40 energy COOLDOWN : 18 / 16. 5 / 15 / 13. 5 / 12 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 350 Active: Shen primes his Spirit Blade , creating an area around it. After 2 seconds, or when Shen or an allied champion enters the area, the Spirit Blade generates a protective zone for 1. 75 seconds, blocking all non- turret basic attacks that hit Shen or allied champions in the area. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Spirit's Refuge's protective zone can be moved while active if Shen uses Twilight Assault . Spirit's Refuge cannot be ranked up at Level 1. Spirit's Refuge will also block damage from all abilities that use basic damage ( Lunge , Mystic Shot , Steel Tempest ). Edit Shadow Dash Shadow Dash COST: 150 energy COOLDOWN : 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 600 / 300 COLLISION RADIUS: 50 / 60 SPEED: 800 + 100% movement speed Passive: Dealing damage with Twilight Assault or Shadow Dash restores 30 / 40 / 50 (based on level) energy . Active: Shen dashes to the target location, dealing physical damage to enemy champions and monsters he passes through and taunting them for 1. 5 seconds. Physical Damage: 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160 (+ 15% bonus health) Twilight Assault and Spirit's Refuge can be cast during the dash. Shadow Dash will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Casting Flash during Shadow Dash will end the dash prematurely, but the end-of-dash collision check will hit enemies at the blink's location still. This still cannot affect the same enemy more than once. The energy restore from Shadow Dash may only occur once. Edit Stand United Stand United COOLDOWN : 200 / 180 / 160 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: Global Active: Shen focuses his will, channeling for 3 seconds and granting the target allied champion a shield for 5 seconds at the time of cast, increased by 0% − 60% (based on target's missing health) . Minimum Shield Strength: 130 / 290 / 450 (+ 135% AP) (+ 16% bonus health) Maximum Shield Strength: 208 / 464 / 720 (+ 216% AP) (+ 25. 6 % bonus health) Upon completing the channel, Shen and his Spirit Blade blink to the target ally's location, placed between them and the nearest enemy champion. Shen also destroys any projectiles targeting him at the time of completion. Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Counters Grounded Disruption Disabled Interrupted Due to several character stats needing to be recalculated each time a character spawns, casting Stand United immediately upon respawning will cause its cooldown to be unaffected by ability haste, and the shielding will not be increased by Shen's ability power , but will be increased by his bonus maximum health . (bug) Stand United can target allies via the mini map or on their portraits or by using the F2 - F5 keys (none of this can be done if Shen is affected by nearsight or his target is untargetable ). Shen will turn to face towards his target ally at the start of the channel. If the target is stealthed , enemies could, in theory, use this to estimate their location. Shen will channel so long as his target is alive (even if the granted shield is broken). If his target dies, the channel is canceled and Stand United goes on full cooldown. Interrupting Stand United's channel will not remove the shield prematurely. The target's screen will glow purple to telegraph that Shen has targeted them with Stand United . It will change back when the channel ends. Shen finds the nearest visible enemy champion within 2000 range from the ally or the nearest invisible champion within 600 range to place himself 175 units from his ally towards that enemy. The following table refers for interactions while Shen is channeling : Type Channel Attacking Disabled Abilities Disabled Movement Disabled Items Usable N/A Disabled All items are disabled Interrupted by N/A Consumables Disabled Spells Usable N/A Disabled Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Flash Teleport Recall Hexflash Mark Dash Interrupted by N/A Interrupted by Death Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins.

Original View in 3D 790 24.03.2010 Among the secretive, Ionian warriors known as the Kinkou, Shen serves as their leader, the Eye of Twilight. He longs to remain free from the confusion of emotion, prejudice, and ego, and walks the unseen path of dispassionate judgment between the spirit realm and the physical world. Tasked with enforcing the equilibrium between them, Shen wields blades of steel and arcane energy against any who would threaten it.

He serves as the personal bodyguard of the group's most important figures, executing interlopers with a cool dispassion, suggesting part of his humanity has already been consumed.

Keith Silverstein Bo Lu World Champions: 2012 Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Pulsefire View in 3D 1350 17.05.2018 Over the millennia, Shen has been called many names: warlord, trespasser, conqueror. Even so, his mission to build an army for the ages seems never-ending. Seeking only the smartest and the strongest to join his ranks, he remains untroubled by emotion, casting his timeless gaze over those with hidden potential.

Where the boy came from only High Command knows, and they aren't talking.

Now Shen mentors young shinobi training to join their ranks – but his new charge may inspire him to take up his sword and join the fight once more. Keith Silverstein Félix Donadio, West Studio Shockblade Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Shockblade Shen Chromas Amethyst Aquamarine Catseye Emerald Obsidian Rose Quartz Ruby Turquoise Ashen Guardian View in 3D Special 23.03.2023 A devotee of the principles of his now slain leader, Shen still walks the castle grounds, wielding his master's blade alongside his own. Perhaps some small part of him recognizes, with each blow to his armor from travelers seeking ancient riches, that his guard is senseless. But life must have meaning. Even life as endless as this.

Shen was the first champion to use energy as a resource for abilities. Before the release of Pulsefire Shen , neither him nor Zed reveal their faces in any of their skins, unlike Akali ( All-star , Nurse , Blood Moon ) and Kennen ( Karate , M.D. ). However, Shen has never revealed his full face in any skin. Shen's dance references Tai chi 24-form . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Shen is the first dark-themed Ionian champion, before Varus , Syndra , Zed , Jhin , Xayah , & Kayn (Noxian-born). Shen, Pantheon , and Twisted Fate were the first to have a global-range teleport ability. After the other two's were heavily changed Shen remained the only one left with such an ability until Rek'Sai was released. Rek'Sai would then later lose her global-range teleport capabilities as well. Shen used to gain the 'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength' cosmetic Easter egg debuff ( "This unit is a flippin' ninja!" - "Ninjas are more effective when they work alone. For every Ninja on your team beyond yourself, you lose 1 health." ) when he, Akali , Kennen , and/or Zed found themselves on the same team. It was removed in V3.14 for unknown reasons.
