Collecting a Chime restores 12% maximum mana and grants Bard 20 + ( 1 per minute after 5 minutes ) experience , as well as 24% bonus movement speed out of combat for 20 seconds, which stacks up to 10 times. Each Chime collected beyond the first instead grants an additional 14% bonus movement speed , up to a total of 150% bonus movement speed . Bard empowers his Meeps each time he collects 5 Chimes . Innate - Meeps: Bard's presence attracts Meeps , which are small spirits that come to his side. While he has Meeps , his basic attacks are empowered to each consume a Meep on-attack to deal 35 ( + 14 per 5 Chimes collected ) (+ 30% AP) bonus magic damage . At 5 Chimes , Meeps slow damaged enemies by 25% − 75% (based on number of Chimes ) for 1 second. At 15 Chimes , Meeps deal the damage to enemies within 150 units of the primary target as well as those in a cone behind them. At 35 Chimes , the cone's radius increases. Meeps spawn every 8 − 4 (based on number of Chimes) seconds and Bard can have up to 1 − 9 (based on number of Chimes) of them at a time. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile See Notes Missing Blocked Primary target takes spell damage , while secondary ones take area damage . Meeps grant additional stacks of Electrocute , Phase Rush and Conqueror . Chime spawns are weighted towards the areas of the map that Bard is currently present in, and spawn every 50 seconds in pairs, with the only exception being the second and third spawns on Summoner's Rift , which spawn only one. Chimes will not spawn in either team's base and will not spawn in the enemy team's jungle before the 5 minute mark. Only Bard can see a chime that is in the fog of war . All other players must have sight of a chime for it to be visible to them. Only Bard can see a minimap icon for an uncollected chime , regardless of whether other players have vision on it or not. The minimap icon will turn red when the chime is one minute away from expiration. Bard cannot see chimes while nearsighted . Only Meep cone attacks are absorbed by spell shields . Those that deal damage together with the basic attack don't. If a Meep empowered auto attack is dodged , blocked or when Bard is blinded , the basic attack itself will deal no damage, but the Meep damage will still be applied. The empowered attack will not trigger against structures and wards .

Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit Chime spawn rate changed to every 30 seconds instead of 50 seconds (initial spawn unchanged). Nexus Blitz differences edit Increased chime spawn rate. First chime spawns at 30 seconds, and spawns 2 new ones every 20 seconds. Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit Meeps thresholds reduced to one each 2 Chimes . Meep respawn time set to 6 seconds. Arena differences edit Increased Chime spawn rate during combat.

Magic Damage: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 65% AP) Disable Duration: 1 / 1. 2 / 1. 4 / 1. 6 / 1. 8 After Cosmic Binding hits an enemy, the bolt continues behind them for 300 units . If the bolt hits terrain or a second enemy, it stuns both targets for the same duration, dealing the same damage to the secondary target. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Cosmic Binding's interaction with spell shields : If the first target has a spell shield, they will block the damage but the bolt will still pass through them. If the bolt hits a second target, only they will be stunned. If the bolt hits terrain, the first target will be stunned. If the second target has a spell shield, they will block the stun and damage. The first target will still be stunned. If the first target gains a spell shield after being hit, the stun will not be blocked. The stun will apply even if the first target becomes untargetable . Cosmic Binding can interact with player-generated terrain . The stun is still applied even if the first or second target dies to the ability itself or before the projectile can bind them. Cosmic Binding does not grant sight of enemies hit, but a hit can be seen and heard to indicate that at least one enemy is there. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Bard_QVideo.ogv Edit Caretaker's Shrine Caretaker's Shrine COST: 70 Mana CAST TIME: 0. 25 RECHARGE: 18 TARGET RANGE: 800 Active: Bard conjures a shrine at the target location that gathers power over 5 seconds, granting sight of its surroundings for 1. 8 seconds . Shrines last until they are consumed by champions moving over them. Up to 3 shrines may be active at a time. If the champion was an ally or Bard himself, they are healed for an amount based on the shrine's power and gain bonus movement speed that decays over 1. 5 seconds. Minimum Heal: 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 (+ 30% AP) Maximum Heal: 50 / 87. 5 / 125 / 162. 5 / 200 (+ 60% AP) Bonus Movement Speed: 20 / 22. 5 / 25 / 27. 5 / 30% (+ 5% per 100 AP) Bard periodically stocks a Caretaker's Shrine charge, up to a maximum of 2. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Location / Unit Caretaker's Shrine can be cast directly on an ally and it will be treated as a unit-targeted ability for effects such as Guardian . If Bard has 3 shrines on the map and creates a new one that is cast directly on himself or an ally, the oldest shrine will not be destroyed. This is because the shrine is used as an actual targeted heal on himself or someone else, and not a permanent shrine, so the other 3 may stay. The spell indicator of Caretaker's Shrine shows the area in which it can be used as a targeted heal. After a shrine has been placed on the ground its activation area becomes smaller: allies or enemies have to step directly on the shrine to use it or destroy it. Leveling up Caretaker's Shrine will update the healing of existing shrines. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Charge time changed to 8 seconds. Now affected by +70 ability haste. Maximum number of shrines active changed to 33. Healing doubled. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Bard_WVideo.ogv Edit Magical Journey Magical Journey COST: 30 Mana COOLDOWN : 22 / 20. 5 / 19 / 17. 5 / 16 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 900 SPEED: 900 / 1197 Active: Bard opens a one-way magical corridor through a piece of terrain in the target direction for 10 seconds. A champion can pass through the corridor by selecting it, becoming revealed during the travel. Bard and allies travel through the portal at 33% increased speed. A nearby valid piece of terrain is required to cast this ability. Magical Journey cannot be taken while immobilized or grounded . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Direction Target out-of-range override The ability will not cast Counters Projectile Grounded Knockdown Not Blocked See Notes Interrupted Terrain also includes structures . Magical Journey's tunnel has a max range of 2600 units (about two screens long) [2] . Magical Journey will score assists for Bard if an ally that uses it scores a kill or assist shortly after. Bard can cast Magical Journey while grounded or rooted . There is no limit to how many times a given instance of Magical Journey may be used. Magical Journey cannot interact with player-created terrain due to its short lifespan. [3] Any abilities that continue during normal movement, such as point blank area of effects and various forms of stealth , will continue during the travel within Magical Journey . If a champion's dash is interrupted while inside terrain using Magical Journey , they will be immediately displaced out to the nearest open space, but are not rendered airborne . Taking Magical Journey is considered a dash , and so will interact with effects such as Sudden Impact and knockdown . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Now affected by +70 ability haste. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Bard_EVideo.ogv Edit Tempered Fate Tempered Fate COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 110 / 95 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 5 TARGET RANGE: 3400 EFFECT RADIUS: 350 Active: Bard sends magical energy arcing to the target location, granting sight of the area during travel. Upon impact, it puts all units within into stasis for 2. 5 seconds, as well as stunning all enemy champions , minions , and turrets struck for the same duration. Enemies hit are revealed for the duration. Epic monsters and turrets are affected by Tempered Fate despite being immune to crowd control . Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Tempered Fate's stun is affected by Tenacity . The stasis is unaffected. Tempered Fate will affect all targetable champions , minions , monsters , turrets , wards , and jungle plants . Tempered Fate has no effect on enemies that have displacement immunity or total crowd control immunity , and allies that are immune from using an ability that preloads UnstoppableForceMarker . The only exceptions are the crowd control immunity that turrets and epic monsters have. All champions (including allies) during the stasis are prohibited from activating cleansing effects for its duration. It will not disable Quicksilver and instead put it on a 3-second cooldown . Tempered Fate deals 0 proc true damage , which triggers in-combat effects such as drawing turret and monster aggression , Sudden Impact or applying Elixir of Sorcery . Elixir of Sorcery deals damage before the target is put into stasis. Tempered Fate's travel time varies between ~0. 65 at point blank and ~1. 8 at max range, resulting in an overall delay of ~1. 15 -2. 3 seconds including the cast time depending on distance covered.

Original View in 3D 880 12.03.2015 A traveler from beyond the stars, Bard is an agent of serendipity who fights to maintain a balance where life can endure the indifference of chaos. Many Runeterrans sing songs that ponder his extraordinary nature, yet they all agree that the cosmic vagabond is drawn to artifacts of great magical power. Surrounded by a jubilant choir of helpful spirit meeps, it is impossible to mistake his actions as malevolent, as Bard always serves the greater good… in his own odd way.

Few records remain of the age before the gods, but it is likely Bard predates them—a truly primordial being, tending the land since time's first dawn.

No one knows where the Teapot Troubadour came from, or if he has a purpose beyond delighting in patisserie, but a visit from Bard instantly puts any cafe on the map!

He knows the mad god Jhin would use that power for his own gain, but Bard will stake his life to prevent it.

In Bard's case, Traveler's Call infinitely stacks the base magic damage of his Meeps . Curiously enough, The Wonder Above is the antithesis of The Terror Beneath , going so far as to both having a portal-opening ability ( Magical Journey and Tunnel ) as well as an enemy-destructible object-placing one ( Caretaker's Shrine and Tunnel ) See also [ ] League of Legends Wiki | Champions Cancelled Champions Ao Shin Avasha Averdrian CeeCee Cyborg Cowboy Eagle Rider Gavid Husk Iron Engineer Ivan Omen Priscilla Rob Blackblade Seth Tabu Tiki Urf Well References [ ] ↑ Bard's profile page at LeagueOfLegends.com ↑ Bard Q&A comment by Rabid Llama ↑ Bard Q&A comment by Rabid Llama
