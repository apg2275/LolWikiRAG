Possible Upgrades for Berserker's Greaves Boots of Mobility Boots of Swiftness Ionian Boots of Lucidity Mercury's Treads Ninja Tabi Sorcerer's Shoes Cost Analysis Gold Value 20 flat movement speed = 260 Total Gold Value = 260 Gold efficiency Alacrity's base stats were 57. 78 % gold efficient. Similar items Captain Distortion Furor Notes Although lacking in gold efficiency , the bonus flat movement speed took up no extra slots ( as opposed to buying a separate item for the movement speed ) and had no ( potentially ) unnecessary stats . Take note that only one enchantment could be bought, and could not be sold without selling the boots themselves. Phage or its upgrades could also be a partial substitute, but only while in combat.
