Immolate and Flametouch both deal default damage , and thus they will not trigger spell effects . Immolate and Flametouch are auto-targeted effects. Immolate will deal 24 (+ 2. 8 % bonus health) magic damage while at 6 stacks, further increased to 30 (+ 3. 5 % bonus health) against minions and to 60 (+ 7% bonus health) against monsters . The aura increases if the user increases in size , but is not impacted by their base size. The aura cannot get reduced below the base radius by negative size modifiers. Because the aura effect must reach an enemy's center to damage them, some melee champions will not apply the effect at their maximum attack range against champions or monsters with a large enough collision radius (for example the Dragon or Rift Herald ). Strategy The increase in Immolate's damage as well as the Flametouch effect allows Tanks to dish out tons of damage while being hard to kill. This is very valuable as they usually rely on the base damage of their abilities. Immolate's burning effect can help champions with otherwise poor wave or jungle clear to be able to efficiently clear minion waves and jungle camps. It also serves as a reliable source of damage in fights. Immolate can be use as a reinforce damage to champs who already haves an ability with similar effect, like Amumu and Nautilus. The Immolate's damage can be stack with others champs Immolate's damage. As a high risk or optional tactic, every or most of the champs in the team can build items with Immolate passive, making the close combat very dangerous for the enemy team. It works much better in teams with champs with high survivality, gab closers or constand CCs, like Amumu and Nautilus. Trivia Media Aura VFX Flametouch VFX
