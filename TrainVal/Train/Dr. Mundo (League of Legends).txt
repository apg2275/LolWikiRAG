Upon resisting one, Dr. Mundo pays a health cost equal to 4% of his current health and propels a canister that lands 525 units in the general direction of its source, remaining on the ground for 7 seconds. Dr. Mundo can move near the canister to consume it, healing himself for 4% of his maximum health and reducing the cooldown of Goes Where He Pleases by 15 seconds.

Goes Where He Pleases will not trigger against nor resist Rell's Magnet Storm's ongoing kinematic effect . It will trigger against and prevent the ability's initial displacement , but even in that case, not prevent the continous effect.

Original View in 3D 260 01.09.2009 Utterly insane, unrepentantly homicidal, and horrifyingly purple, Dr. Mundo is what keeps many of Zaun’s citizens indoors on particularly dark nights. This monosyllabic monstrosity seems to want nothing more than pain—both the giving of it, and the receiving of it. Wielding his massive meat cleaver as if it were weightless, Mundo is infamous for capturing and torturing dozens of Zaun’s citizens for his nefarious 'operations,' which seem to have no overall point or goal. He is brutal. He is unpredictable. He goes where he pleases. He is also not, technically, a doctor. Armen Taylor Alex 'alexplank' Flores Loot eligible Toxic View in 3D 520 17.12.2009 Mundo not toxic, Mundo has healthy emotional coping mechanisms—oh, you mean purple goo? Mundo is sure that's fine, too. Armen Taylor West Studio Silver Age Loot eligible Legacy Mr. Mundoverse View in 3D 520 24.03.2010 Mundo didn't mean to become fitness influencer, but Mundo's gains speak for themselves.

Armen Taylor Marie Magny, West Studio Omen of the Dark Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Rageborn Mundo View in 3D 975 27.07.2012 There are many tales of the Rageborn menace: that he's slain dragons with a single cleave, that the mightiest wizards cannot halt his advances, that no noble knight foolish enough to try and stop him has ever come back alive. The accounts often contradict each other, but the one thing they all agree on is this: Where Mundo goes, no one else pleases.

Armen Taylor Augusto Quirino, West Studio Street Demons Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Street Demons Dr. Mundo Chromas Citrine Emerald Obsidian Rose Quartz Ruby Sandstone Tanzanite Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Dr. Mundo, the Madman of Zaun "Mundo" has two real world origins: the Proto-Germanic *mundo "hand, protection" & unrelated Ibero- Romance mundo "world" (like in Spanish, Portuguese, etc.). He is named after Edmundo 'odnumde' Sanchez , by Brandon 'Ryze' Beck . [2] Dr. Mundo's dance references the titular character from House, M.D. in turn dancing to Fight the Power by Public Enemy . A side-by-side comparison be seen here . In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, the following change regarding Dr. Mundo were jokingly listed： Dr. Mundo decided that he enjoys the color blue. Dr. Mundo now has mana. None of his ability costs have changed. Masochism references the eponymous term for enjoyment derived from being inflicted pain, named after real-life writer Leopold von Sacher-Masoch . This is also mechanically referenced in his kit by gaining a higher AD bonus the lower his health is. The ability's name also fits for the early iterations of his E ability, which caused Dr. Mundo to be healed instead of being damaged from physical attacks for a duration. Sadism references the eponymous term for enjoyment derived from inflicting pain on others, named after real-life writer Marquis de Sade . The name chosen for this ability made the most sense for the early iterations of his R ability, which damaged nearby enemies for their current health. Dr. Mundo, the Madman of Zaun Dr. Mundo is one of 20 champions without a single ability power ratio on any ability: Aatrox , Camille , Darius , Draven , Garen , Kayn , Kled , Naafiri , Nilah , Olaf , Pyke , Riven , Samira , Sett , Talon , Urgot , Xayah , Yone , and Zed . Out of them, Dr. Mundo is the only one without an attack damage ratio on any of his abilities. Dr. Mundo is one of six champions who use health as a resource for abilities, the other five being Soraka , Vladimir , Olaf , Zac and Briar . His dance is a Pec Flex which involves flexing his pectoral muscles. His death animation shows him assume the morgue pose whilst adding a toe tag to himself. Goes Where He Pleases is among a few abilities that were named after a quote of their champion. In this case, it references his "Mundo goes where he pleases" quote which he had before the patch he got the ability, V11.12 . The others are Draven's League of Draven and Graves' End of the Line . Following his rework, his kit was given a higher emphasis on medical equipment and terms, thus making several references to them. Infected Bonesaw was renamed from Infected Cleaver to have Dr. Mundo utilize the actual medical tool . Heart Zapper is based on the act of defibrillation . Blunt Force Trauma references the term for the eponymous injury type .
