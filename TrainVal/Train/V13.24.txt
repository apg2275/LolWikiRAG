Arena [ ] Gameplay Gates Hex-gates have been added to each of the 4 battle arenas, which function the same as those on the Hextech Rift map on Summoner's Rift. Champions on either team can interact with these gates to dash to the other side of them. Gates have a 7-second cooldown after being activated. Downed State/Reviving When a champion on either team takes fatal damage for the first time each round, they enter a downed state where they are essentially dead . After 11-8 seconds (based on round number) of being downed , their ally can stand near where they entered the state for 3 seconds to afterwards revive them, healing them for 150 − 1425 (based on level) and causing them to become untargetable , invulnerable , and unable to attack or cast spells for 0. 75 seconds. They will also gain 30% damage reduction, 75% bonus movement speed , and 50% Tenacity for 3 seconds, decaying after 0. 75 seconds over the remaining duration. The amount of time required for the revive to occur is cumulative; leaving the downed area will not reset the timer. The ally must not be under a resurrection effect in order to perform the revive. Revive duration is reduced based on the ally's heal and shield power as well as their missing health . Cameos The cameos for the following champions have been removed: Evelynn , Jhin , Lux , Naafiri , Samira , Shaco , and Viego . The following cameos have been added: Sylas' Great Mage Rebellion: At the start of the combat round, Sylas breaks the chains to replace each champion's non- Flash summoner spell with a random ultimate ability. Once the hijacked ability is cast, the spell in the slot is reverted back to the original one. Thresh's Midnight Express: Thresh roams around the battlefield to provide assistance. He periodically casts his Dark Passage to the champion furthest from him which also grants the nearest champion with the lowest health a continuous shield . Any champion on either team can interact with the lantern on the ground to dash to Thresh's location. If one of a team's champions is caught and downed in the Ring of Fire , Thresh will move to that player's location and throw his lantern towards their ally. Additionally, if one team outnumbers the other in alive members, he will always throw his lantern to the disadvantaged team. Items Hellfire Hatchet - New exclusive item Cost: 3000 .
