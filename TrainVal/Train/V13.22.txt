[1] Quickplay will be released to live region by region in patch 13.22. Blind Pick queue will be disabled along with Quickplay release. Added new client GUI for the purposes of Quickplay queueing. The player may select a Primary and a Secondary position, one champion for each role, their respective cosmetics loadouts, one set of summoner spells per selected champion, and one rune page per selected champion. Champion Select is entirely absent from this queue; successful AFK checks immediately start the game. Selection restrictions for parties of one (solo): 2 unique champions, 2 unique positions (1 Priority position minimum). Selection restrictions for parties of two to four: All solo restrictions apply, 1 unique champion per player minimum, mutually exclusive Primary positions per player. Selection restrictions for parties of five (full team): No Secondary position selection, mutually exclusive positions and champions per player. New player available champion rotation expanded to: Amumu , Caitlyn , Diana , Jinx , Kai'Sa , Leona , Malphite , Mordekaiser , Pantheon , Rammus , Sett , Sona , Syndra , Talon , Teemo , Tristana , Vi , Viktor , Yuumi , Ziggs .
