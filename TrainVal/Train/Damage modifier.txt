Damage modifiers refer to damage instances that are modified by a percentage or flat value, causing the damage dealt to be increased or decreased. Buffs or debuffs usually affect the damage dealt or taken by a unit, while damaging abilities and spells can modify their damage dealt under certain conditions. It is important to note that damage modifiers do not add bonus damage but affect all of the damage dealt by an instance. Damage modifiers may also only affect specific damage sub-types ( physical , magic , or true ). Buffs or debuffs that modify damage are granted by abilities , items , runes , and summoner spells .

Some flat damage reductions are factored in after armor or magic resistance. This makes it significantly better the more resistances you have. In addition, periodic damage effects will have each tick of damage reduced. For example, Malzahar's Malefic Visions ticks 8 times, so 1 flat damage reduction would reduce its total damage by 8. Flat damage reduction does not work against true damage.
