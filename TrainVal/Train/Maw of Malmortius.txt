New Effect: Lifeline now scales with ( 135% / 101. 25 % ) AP . Strategy Maw of Malmortius is best used against champions that deal high amounts of magic damage. Maw of Malmortius' shield can absorb most of the initial burst of magic damage dealt by an enemy champion and give its user an opportunity to keep fighting or retreat. Maw of Malmortius still provides less effective health against magic damage than dedicated, anti-magic damage defensive items like Spirit Visage or Force of Nature . However, the item comes with the advantage of not sacrificing offensive potential, which allows an physical damage dealing champion to better recover from behind when facing an enemy magic damage dealing champion.
