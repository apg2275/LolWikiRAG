This version of the game had a Hotfix one day before the release day. New Skins in the Store Goth Annie King Rammus PvP.Net v0.29.03 General Art for the "End of Game" has been updated. The summoner profile page now shows more detailed stats for the last 10 games played. Masteries that you do not have the pre-requisites for are now grayed out for easier visual reference. The champion select screens have been improved with minor visual adjustments. All experience bars are now consistent in style and color. "Champion Skin Browsing Art" has been improved. Bugs Fixed a bug in the summoner profile that showed the experience bar as always full. Fixed a bug that was causing the buddy list to not show the correct status during or after games. League of Legends v1.0.0.32 New in-game HUD Information is better compartmentalized with your abilities, health, mana, and experience in the center; player information and stats on the left; and the mini-map unchanged on the right. New Team Indicators allow you to quickly compare your own health against your target's. More usable gameplay space, with less HUD interference while playing on the purple team. More minimalist but higher quality art. Smarter scaling means that UI scale will no longer affect chat and buffs. New Two-Lane Map – Twisted Treeline Twisted Treeline is one of the few remaining forests near Zaun that has not been exploited for natural resources; a mere cursory glance at the geography of the arena quickly explains why. The misuse of magic – mainly from Zaun but also from the numerous battles fought here during the various Rune Wars – has warped the verdant environs of the Twisted Treeline into terrain into a bizarre, alien-like visage. Twisted Treeline can be accessed in the Practice Game section. Champions Ashe General Updated particles.
