Against non-champions, basic attacks and Boomerang Throw instantly generate 「 0. 5 / 0. 875 / 1. 375 (based on level) Rage . 」 「 12. 5 % of the amount. 」 Against champions, Boomerang Throw instantly generates 「 1 / 1. 75 / 2. 75 (based on level) Rage , 」 「 25% of the amount, 」 and basic attacks instantly generate 「 2 / 3. 5 / 5. 5 (based on level) . 」 「 50% of the amount. 」 Boomerang Throw can only generate Rage once per cast, and grants Rage based on the first enemy hit. Gnar's Rage decays after being out of combat for 13 seconds. At maximum Rage , Gnar's abilities are switched to Mega Gnar's abilities for 4 seconds. Casting one of Mega Gnar's abilities will cause him to transform into Mega Gnar , else he will transform automatically after the 4 seconds have elapsed. Gnar's Mega form lasts for 15 seconds, with his Rage bar depleting as an indication of remaining time. Rage cannot be generated while in this form. Afterwards, Gnar returns to Mini Gnar , retaining his current percentage health and becoming too tired to generate Rage for 15 seconds. Gnar gains different stat bonuses based on whether he is in Mini or Mega form. Both of Gnar's forms share their ability cooldowns. Link ▶️ "GNAR!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive The Rage generated upon dealing or receiving damage occurs over 2 seconds with 4 ticks every 0. 5 seconds. It also does not stack but instead refreshes with subsequent applications (of dealing or receiving damage). The bonus rage generation on basic attacks counts as an on-hit effect, and is triggered by Runaan's Hurricane and Guinsoo's Rageblade . In-game, the value on the Rage bar always displays rounded down to the nearest integer. Mega Gnar's gained health is not affected by healing modifiers such as Grievous Wounds and those from items and runes . When returning to Mini Gnar , Gnar will only retain his current health percentage, not current health total. This is intentional to prevent Gnar from simply triggering Rage Gene in order to heal himself over time. Gnar's abilities share cooldowns across forms. The final stats, after Rage Gene being applied, can be seen on Mini Gnar's and Mega Gnar's respective data template, in the front page . Mini Gnar gains 5. 5 % − 99% (based on level) bonus attack speed . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Fury generation changed to 150%. Edit Mini Gnar Mini Gnar Innate: Gnar gains bonus movement speed , bonus attack range , attack speed , as well as attack speed growth .

After reaching its maximum range or hitting an enemy, the boomerang flies back toward Gnar based on his current movement, dealing 50% damage to subsequent targets. Physical Damage: 5 / 45 / 85 / 125 / 165 (+ 115% AD) Reduced Damage: 2. 5 / 22. 5 / 42. 5 / 62. 5 / 82. 5 (+ 57. 5 % AD) Slow: 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35% Catching the boomerang while it is returning back refunds 40% of the ability's total cooldown . Enemies can be hit only once per pass. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked The boomerang return direction is determined at the apex of its flight by Gnar's current position and which direction Gnar is heading at the time. Since the cooldown between the two is shared, Mini Gnar may pick up a boulder and/or Mega Gnar may catch a boomerang . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Edit Hyper Hyper Passive: Gnar's basic attacks on-hit and ability hits apply a stack of Hyper to enemies for 3. 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 3 times. The third stack against a target consumes them all to deal bonus magic damage , capped at 300 against monsters , and grant Gnar 20 / 40 / 60 / 80% (based on GNAR!'s rank) bonus movement speed that decays over 3 seconds. Bonus Magic Damage: 0 / 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 (+ 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 14% of target's maximum health) (+ 100% AP) Gnar gains Hyper's bonus movement speed when he leaves Mega form. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked The bonus movement speed's duration refreshes whenever Gnar would receive it (by hitting a target three times again). Edit Hop Hop COOLDOWN: 22 / 19. 5 / 17 / 14. 5 / 12 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 475 EFFECT RADIUS: 150 Active: Gnar leaps to the target location, then gains bonus attack speed for 6 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% If Gnar lands on a unit he will bounce 500 units further in the same direction. Landing on an enemy deals them physical damage and slows them by 80% for 0. 5 seconds. Physical Damage: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 6% maximum health) Gnar will not bounce if he is immobilized , excluding from sleep (bug) , during the first leap. Boomerang Throw can be cast during the dash. Hop will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Hop does not allow Gnar to bounce off wards. Hop does not grant bonus attack speed if used to transform. If Hop generates Rage to maximum and Gnar bounces off an enemy, he may cast GNAR! during the bounce. Edit Mega Gnar Mega Gnar Innate: Gnar gains the following increases to his base statistics: 100 − 831 (based on level) base health , 3. 5 − 54. 5 (based on level) base armor , 3. 5 − 63 (based on level) base magic resistance , and 8 − 50. 5 (based on level) base attack damage . Gnar's base stats including these bonuses are provided at the top of Gnar's gameplay article, and will appear separately as Mega Gnar on list articles. Gnar restores health equal to the amount gained when transforming into Mega Gnar , but will only retain his current percentage health when returning to Mini form. This is not affected by healing modifiers. Edit Boulder Toss Boulder Toss COOLDOWN: 20 / 17. 5 / 15 / 12. 5 / 10 CAST TIME: 0. 5 RANGE: 1150 EFFECT RADIUS: 250 WIDTH: 180 SPEED: 2100 Active: Gnar throws a boulder in the target direction that stops upon hitting an enemy, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies upon impact and slowing them for 2 seconds. The boulder then remains on the ground for 6 seconds. Physical Damage: 45 / 90 / 135 / 180 / 225 (+ 140% AD) Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% After 0. 3 seconds, Gnar can pick up the boulder by moving within 90 units of it, refunding 70% of the ability's total cooldown . Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Since the cooldown between the two is shared Mini Gnar may pick up a boulder and/or Mega Gnar may catch a boomerang . The Boulder will still drop to the ground if colliding with Wind Wall or Unbreakable . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Edit Wallop Wallop COOLDOWN: 7 CAST TIME: 0. 6 RANGE: 550 WIDTH: 200 Active: Gnar slams his arm down in the target direction, dealing physical damage to all enemies struck within the area and stunning them for 1. 25 seconds.

Physical Damage: 80 / 115 / 150 / 185 / 220 (+ 6% maximum health) If Crunch is used to transform, Gnar will still be able to bounce as per Hop . The shockwave will occur where Gnar lands. Enemies Gnar lands directly on top of are affected by Hop's slow . Crunch will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Gnar is locked out of using any other abilities during Crunch , but he can still transform mid-air if he reaches 100 Rage during the jump of Hop . If Crunch is cast to transform and Gnar bounces off of an enemy, he may cast GNAR! during the bounce. If Crunch is used to transform, the area of effect is missing at the first landing location, whether he bounces off a target or not. (bug) If circumstances allow it, Crunch's shockwave from using it to transform can hit the target Gnar bounced off of. Edit GNAR! GNAR!

Gnar's concept is built on monstrous transformations in fiction coupled with the Fish Out of Water trope. Inspirations include Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson , Gremlins , and Hulk by Marvel Comics . Paleontologically speaking, Gnar is not a missing link, i.e. transitional specimen , but he belongs to the Yordle population ancestral to modern ones; colloquially-speaking, he is the great-great-...-granduncle of all living Yordles. In Brazilian localization, Gnar's title was changed to O Yordle Pré-histórico ('the Prehistoric Yordle') in order to avoid matchmaking-rating-associated jokes/bullying derived from O Elo Perdido ('the Missing Link'). Gnar is the second champion to have two champion portraits ( Mini Gnar and Mega Gnar ) the first being Quinn and Valor . He is also the third to have more than one chat name, the first being Anivia and Eggnivia and the second being anyone polymorphed by Lulu ( Squill ). As well as the seventh champion to have more than four abilities, the others being Elise , Heimerdinger , Jayce , Karma , Nidalee , Lee Sin , Rek'Sai and Yorick . Mini Gnar has the fewest active abilities of any ranged champion ( Hyper and GNAR! are fully passive effects) and the lowest health at Level 18 (1645). Mega Gnar has his own separate emotes from Mini Gnar's. His dance references Donkey Kong . Boulder Toss ' projectile is shaped like the Riot Games Inc. logo. Mega Gnar has the highest level 18 base attack damage (157). Although patch V7.16 made it so the portrait of the selected skin would be used in the central portion of the in-game UI, transforming into Mega Gnar always uses his base portrait for all skins. Hop has the shortest ability name at 3 characters long. For contrast Life Form Disintegration Ray is the longest ability name at 29 characters long, exceeding Hop by 26 characters.
