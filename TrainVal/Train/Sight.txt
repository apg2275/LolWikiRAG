Quinn using Heightened Senses . Note the Krug camp at the top left, normally not visible from her position. Sight is a property of all units and certain abilities , summoner spells , and items in League of Legends that represents a team possessing vision over an area. Inversely, the area of the map in which a team does not have sight over is known as the Fog of War , a common hallmark of the Real-Time Strategy genre. The Fog of War is represented visually as a dark shroud over the map. Possessing sight is necessary to observe most information about any non-allied units in the game. Such information includes the unit's current location and facing direction, stats and status bar, purchased items, and score. Thus the acquisition and denial of sight is one of the most crucial mechanics of the game.

All champion summoned units have a vision radius, unless otherwise stated. Items and abilities do not always grant sight and those that do often have differing applications of the mechanic to one another. Blocking sight [ ] There are two obstacles that block regular sight, impassable terrain (which is always opaque to vision granted by units, structures and most items and abilities) and brush (which is opaque towards vision when viewed from the outside inwards and not the reverse). Such barriers will also block vision of any areas that are directly behind them from the sight-granting unit. Units that can directly observe an area around these obstacles are commonly described as having line of sight towards that area. Sight can be removed in three ways: The withdrawal of any sight-granting units, abilities, or items from the vicinity (e.g. also by death ) The expiration of a sight-granting debuff or spell Directly though the nearsight debuff (which currently only exists with Graves' Smoke Screen , Nocturne's Paranoia , and Quinn's Blinding Assault ). Note that despite looking like such, Rek'Sai's Burrow does not nearsight her, since she conserves allied vision Forms of sight [ ] Standard sight [ ] A ward granting standard sight over the area. This is the most common form of vision that is able to reveal Fog of War and units altogether. By default, when an ally uses a unit-targeted spell, including basic attacks , on an enemy unit from inside Fog of War , a 300-unit radius of Fog of War is revealed for the enemy team centered on the attacker which grants vision for 2 seconds after the attack completes. True sight [ ] A unit revealing a stealthed trap . A pink eye symbol above a unit indicates they have true sight vision. This is a unique form of sight that is able to see units concealed in stealth , who are usually undetectable when under standard sight (such as wards and standard sight debuffs ). All sources of true sight currently in the game also provide standard sight - otherwise, true sight follows the same rules as standard sight. True sight cannot bypass sight blocked by nearsight . All turrets and some abilities and items and a few others possess a form of true sight , mostly by revealing debuffs. Obscured vision [ ] A silhouette of a unit observed behind a wall, indicating a form of obscured vision . This is a form of detection that does not innately reveal units nor make them targetable in any sort of way. Instead, the unit's position is merely distinguished by their movement and actions or silhouette, revealing their position in the process. The unit is still not visible however, thus being unable to selected for unit-targeted attacks. Obscured vision exists in many effects, the most common ones being in Rek'Sai's Burrow and Oracle Lens . It is unaffected by nearsight . Unobstructed vision [ ] A unit with unobstructed vision being able to see enemies behind walls. This is a type of sight that permeates through terrain. It allows the unit to be able to see beyond their sight radius if otherwise obstructed by terrain, although they won't be able to see into brush unless they had sight of the inside. Aurelion Sol's Astral Flight , Kayn's Shadow Step , Smolder's Flap, Flap, Flap , Talon's Assassin's Path , Zeri's Spark Surge and Zoe's Portal Jump are the only abilities that benefit from unobstructed vision . A unit with unobstructed vision becoming unable to see out of terrain while nearsighted . Nearsight prevents unobstructed vision entirely; units lose the ability to see behind walls for the duration and if they would be inside terrain, their sight is completely restricted until they move out to open space. Sources of sight [ ] Effects listed below have individual reveal ranges and durations.
