The item becomes gold efficient in 31 minutes and 32 seconds without using Tribute , or after 26 hits against a champion or structure while Tribute is off cooldown (including any time or hits with Timeworn Spellthief's Edge or Timeworn Frostfang before the upgrade) . Similar items Timeworn Face of the Mountain Timeworn Talisman of Ascension Twin Shadows Notes The quest reward can only be obtained after being out of combat for 5 seconds. Unlike Timeworn Spellthief's Edge and Timeworn Frostfang , Timeworn Frost Queen's Claim's passive cannot be disabled. Each ability (even if Area of effect or Damage over time ) will trigger Tribute only once per spell cast ( Brand's Passive will not count as a different ability). Bard's Meeps and Lulu's Pix attacks count as a single spell, and can trigger Tribute twice with a single basic attack. On-hit effects will not trigger Tribute . If you damage an enemy champion or structure 3 times every 30 seconds, Tribute grants 20 per 10. Plus 2 per 10 from the item, you can receive a total of 22 per 10. Strategy Upgrading Timeworn Frostfang to Timeworn Frost Queen's Claim does not improve its ability to generate gold, other than by removing the passive disable when killing minions. The upgrade from Timeworn Frostfang costs 1350 and grants 1061 worth of AP and CDR. For the upgrade to be worth it, the active and the removal of the passive disabling when killing minions, must be worth 289 . If the active gains or denies one kill, the upgrade was worth it. Brand's Blaze's explosion can create a chain reaction that can trigger the passive multiple times. Trivia Timeworn Face of the Mountain , Timeworn Frost Queen's Claim , and Timeworn Talisman of Ascension are a set of items available since Season Eight that were designed for Support . They were themed after locations from Runeterra that all incidentally involve a form of physical transcendence. This item is a relic of Frost Queen's Claim , which was removed along with Sightstone to allow champions to obtain more diverse build paths. [1]
