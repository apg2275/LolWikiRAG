This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. The total damage to a single target will be split evenly among each bolt that hits, meaning that hitting with more bolts will deal less damage per hit (but more overall damage). Spell shield will block all bolts.

Video Edit Nevermove Nevermove COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN : 10 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 850 EFFECT RADIUS: 100 WIDTH: 170 SPEED: 935 / 1235 / 1735 / 2735 (based on time) / 600 / 1400 / 2200 (based on time) Active: Swain launches a demonic wave in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies hit. Magic Damage: 35 / 70 / 105 / 140 / 175 (+ 25% AP) At maximum range, the wave homes back to Swain and detonates upon the first enemy hit, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies and rooting them for 1. 5 seconds, during which they are revealed . Nevermove can be recast while champions hit are rooted. Magic Damage: 35 / 45 / 55 / 65 / 75 (+ 25% AP) Total Magic Damage: 70 / 115 / 160 / 205 / 250 (+ 50% AP) Recast: Swain pulls the rooted champions over 290 units and collects a Soul Fragment from each of them. If the targets would be brought past Swain , they are instead knocked back the excess distance. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Nevermove's missiles have their speed update to accelerate at specific times by the server. The client applies these speed increases after additional specified delays, while the hitbox behaviour itself only uses the timings noted above. Nevermove's recast can be used during the cast time of other spells. Spell shields block either the pass-through or the detonation, not both. If the root is not applied to or is removed from all champions, the recast does not become available. The pull will interrupt channels at the very beginning, but does not keep the target stunned for the rest of the movement. Channels can be started successfully during the pull, provided the previous crowd control does not prevent them still. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. if the target champion is rooted by Nevermove but becomes spell-immune before the pull, Swain will not receive a soul fragment on reactivation since the champion cannot be displaced. Video Edit Demonic Ascension Demonic Ascension COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 100 / 80 / 60 CAST TIME: 0. 5 EFFECT RADIUS: 650 Active: Swain frees the demon within himself, gaining Demonic Ascension and generating 50 Demonic Energy . Demonic Ascension is maintained with Demonic Energy , which decays by 5 every 0. 5 seconds, increased to 7. 5 after 5 seconds have elapsed. Swain generates 10 Demonic Energy every 0. 5 seconds while draining from at least one enemy champion , and fully restores it to the maximum of 50 upon scoring a champion takedown . Demonic Ascension: Swain is ghosted and drains the lifeforce of nearby enemies, both dealing magic damage and healing himself each second per target affected. The heal is reduced by 90% against minions and monsters . Nevermove's cooldown is also reduced by 20%. Magic Damage per Tick: 20 / 40 / 60 (+ 10% AP) Heal per Tick: 15 / 27. 5 / 40 (+ 18% AP) Reduced Healing: 1. 5 / 2. 75 / 4 (+ 1. 8 % AP) After 2 seconds, Swain can cast Demonflare , and does so automatically when Demonic Ascension expires. The targets do not have to be visible to be hit by this ability. Edit Demonflare Demonflare CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 675 WIDTH: 60 SPEED: 3000 Active: Swain releases a nova of soulfire that deals magic damage to nearby enemies and slows them by 60%, decaying over 1. 5 seconds.

Though he was cast down and crippled in the Ionian wars, his left arm severed, he seized control of the empire with ruthless determination.. and a new, demonic hand. Now, Swain commands from the front lines, marching against a coming darkness that only he can see—in glimpses gathered by shadowy ravens from the corpses all around him. In a swirl of sacrifice and secrets, the greatest secret of all is that the true enemy lies within.

But instead, a lone, grizzled veteran striding across the tundra. Some things are better left to the Grand General.

He desired the Aurora's blessings to better provide meat and pelts for his people. After making his case, he gave the smallest of bows to Polaris, who watched with a face as serene as moonlit ice. Satisfied, Swain stepped aside and waited for his gift.

Swain's raven is named Beatrice. [2] Beatrice can be seen on the Crystal Scar . She will land on the barrier near the Boneyard node for a short time and then fly off. Swain's Ravenous Flock transformation has a similar appearance to Tzeentch's daemon servants, the Lords of Change , from the Warhammer franchise. The icon for Ravenous Flock is similar to the old one for Tides of Blood . The Art Spotlight for his first splash art is the first one ever released. If Swain dies while casting Decrepify , there will be two Beatrices on the battlefield, one attached to the laser and one on his back when he falls to the ground. The ending quote to Swain's background is based on Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 . In the League of Legends , Swain was unable to compete in the Ionia Versus Noxus Grudge Match due to his recent induction into Noxian High Command, thus needing to take time away from the League to put all his affairs in order. In the 2014 version of the Ultra Rapid Fire featured game mode , Ravenous Flock would toggle-off once its mana cost scaled beyond Swain's maximum mana. This was the only ability affected by the restriction of a champion requiring sufficient maximum mana in order to activate an ability within the game mode. Swain, the Noxian Grand General Swain is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect: Aurelion Sol , Bard , Bel'Veth , Cho'Gath , Draven , Kindred , Nasus , Senna , Shyvana , Sion , Smolder , Sylas , Thresh , and Veigar . In Swain's case, Ravenous Flock infinitely stacks his health . Swain's Vision of Empire is the longest ranged basic ability in League of Legends, at 7500 units. It used to tied with Comet of Legend before Aurelion Sol's CGU. It used to be the longest limited ranged ability, but was overtaken by Certain Death . While dancing, he whistles a tune from his theme. His dance references Fred Astaire's Top Hat, White Tie & Tails dance . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. While playing a game on Summoner's Rift , Swain's flock of Ravens (depending on the skin it could also be Snow Owls, Macaws, Demon birds, or Dragons) can be seen around the map. His mannerisms, quotes and the "Grand General" persona are reminiscent of Tywin Lannister from Game of Thrones . At the start of the game, there is a chance of thematic music with ravens in the background. His demonic left arm could be a reference to Murtaugh in the Submachine series . After losing his left arm, Murtaugh discovered he had a third "karma" arm, which was extremely powerful and capable of causing mass destruction. Murtaugh pursues his goals with similar ruthlessness as Swain. The sigil that appears beneath Swain when his ultimate ability is cast has three runes and three eyes inscribed into it. This is possibly a reference to the Three-eyed Raven from the book series A Song of Ice and Fire , considering both characters possess the ability to see events occurring around the world through magical means. The sigil used in Original Swain , Northern Front Swain , Bilgewater Swain , and Tyrant Swain is an edited version of the sigil that appears when Gatekeeper Galio uses his ultimate ability . [3] Dragon Master Swain uses the unedited of the sigil. The head of Raum, Swain's demon, shortly appears above Swain when he uses his ultimate ability.
