These two bonuses do not stack with each other. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Crimson Pact only affects Vladimir's maximum health and will not increase Vladimir's current health to prevent Vladimir from restoring health whenever his AP fluctuates. Vladimir's current health can decrease to match his maximum health if Crimson Pact's bonus health is lost. Crimson Pact's bonus ability power stacks multiplicatively with other sources of % ability power but its bonus health stacks additively with other sources of bonus health . Examples on how they calculate below: Case 1: With Rabadon's Deathcap you get a total of ( 40% AP + 4. 6662 % bonus health ) bonus ability power and ( 224% AP + 2. 13312 % bonus health ) bonus health . Case 2: With Vigilant Wardstone you get a total of ( 20% AP + 4. 79952 % bonus health ) bonus ability power and ( 192% AP + 21. 279872 % bonus health ) bonus health . Case 3: With both Rabadon's Deathcap and Vigilant Wardstone you get a total of ( 60% AP + 6. 39936 % bonus health ) bonus ability power and ( 256% AP + 23. 839616 % bonus health ) bonus health . Edit Transfusion Transfusion COOLDOWN: 9 / 7. 9 / 6. 8 / 5. 7 / 4. 6 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 600 Active: Vladimir drains blood from the target enemy, dealing magic damage and healing himself. He then generates a stack of Bloodthirst over the cooldown , which is displayed in his secondary resource bar. Magic Damage: 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 / 160 (+ 60% AP) Heal: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+ 35% AP) At 2 stacks, Vladimir gains 10% / 20% / 30% / 40% (based on level) bonus movement speed for 0. 5 seconds, and enters Crimson Rush while the Bloodthirst depletes over 2. 5 seconds. The Bloodthirst depletes 75% slower during Sanguine Pool , Tides of Blood , or stasis . Crimson Rush Bonus: Transfusion consumes all Bloodthirst to deal 85% increased damage and heal Vladimir for an additional 30 − 200 (based on level) (+ 5% (+ 4% per 100 AP) of his missing health) , reduced to 35% against minions . Increased Damage: 148 / 185 / 222 / 259 / 296 (+ 111% AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Even though the healing effect is visualized as a projectile, the healing itself triggers instantly. Vladimir's resource bar changes colors depending on Bloodthirst's charge-up. White while generating the first stack and while at 1 stack (there is no time-out period). Orange while generating the second stack. Red while Crimson Rush is active ( Bloodthirst will deplete over 2. 5 seconds once triggered). Each stack generates over-time ( Transfusion's cooldown). Vladimir can cast Sanguine Pool and Hemoplague during Transfusion's cast time. The Bloodthirst depletes normally while under resurrection effects. Edit Sanguine Pool Sanguine Pool COST: 20% current health COOLDOWN: 28 / 25 / 22 / 19 / 16 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 350 Active: Vladimir sinks into a pool of blood, becoming untargetable and ghosted for 2 seconds. He also gains 37. 5 % bonus movement speed that decays exponentially over 1 second. Enemies within the pool are dealt magic damage every 0. 5 seconds over the duration and are slowed by 40%. Vladimir heals himself for 15% of the pre-mitigation damage dealt. Magic Damage Per Tick: 20 / 33. 75 / 47. 5 / 61. 25 / 75 (+ 2. 5 % bonus health) Total Magic Damage: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 10% bonus health) Vladimir cannot use basic attacks nor abilities during Sanguine Pool, but he can still move. If Tides of Blood is charging at the time of Sanguine Pool's activation, that ability may still be recast. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Magic The first tick damages immediately so the final one occurs 0. 5 seconds before Vladimir becomes targetable again. There is an extra damage tick for 0 damage when Vladimir becomes targetable again, triggering the same spell effects as the normal ticks (except those which require damage greater than 0 being dealt). This will trigger turret aggro onto Vladimir if an enemy champion is still within the effect radius when Sanguine Pool ends. The slow ends immediately once affected enemies get out of range. Vladimir can still use summoner spells and item actives during Sanguine Pool . While unable to attack, Vladimir can still input attack commands - causing him to follow his attack target. Vladimir's attack range is reduced 「 to 0 」 「 by 450 」 while pooled - causing him to attempt to move right up to his attack target. Edit Tides of Blood Tides of Blood COST: 2 / 4 / 6 / 8% (based on charge time) maximum health COOLDOWN : 13 / 11 / 9 / 7 / 5 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 600 WIDTH: 120 SPEED: 4000 Active: Vladimir charges for up to 1. 5 seconds, during which he increases Tides of Blood's damage over the first second of the channel, and becomes slowed by 20% afterwards for the remaining duration. Tides of Blood can be recast within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards or if it is interrupted . Recast: Vladimir unleashes a nova of 15 blood bolts around himself that each deal magic damage to the first enemy hit, increased based on charge time, up to the first second. Minimum Magic Damage: 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 (+ 1. 5 % maximum health) (+ 35% AP) Maximum Magic Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 6% maximum health) (+ 80% AP) If Tides of Blood was charged for at least 1 second, enemies hit are also slowed for 0. 5 seconds. Slow: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% Enemies can intercept multiple bolts, but can be damaged only once. If Vladimir is below 12% of his maximum health , Tides of Blood will not cost any health . Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Disruption Blocked Blocked Interrupted The spell indicator shows 11 equally spaced missile indicators when hovering the ability in the HUD, however the spell actually casts 15 equally spaced missiles. The health cost may still drop Vladimir below the specified amount if he is above it. This is verified for every tick of health cost, i.e if the first tick drops him below it, the next ones will stop affecting him if he remains below it.

After the duration, the infection bursts to deal magic damage to all affected targets and, after a 0. 4 -second delay, heal Vladimir for each infected champion, reduced by 40% for champions beyond the first.

Hemoplague amplifies itself for an actual 165 / 275 / 385 (+ 77% AP) damage. Hemoplague's modifier to incoming damage stacks additively with Alistar's Unbreakable Will for a total damage reduction of 45/55/65%. * Spell shield does not negate the detonation.

Original View in 3D 790 27.07.2010 A fiend with a thirst for mortal blood, Vladimir has influenced the affairs of Noxus since the empire’s earliest days. In addition to unnaturally extending his life, his mastery of hemomancy allows him to control the minds and bodies of others as easily as his own. In the flamboyant salons of the Noxian aristocracy, this has enabled him to build a fanatical cult of personality around himself—while in the lowest back alleys, it allows him to bleed his enemies dry. Kevin M. Connolly Michal Ivan, Puppetworks Animation Studio Loot eligible Count View in 3D 520 27.07.2010 Once upon a time, in the heart of a dark and gloomy castle, there lived an eternally youthful count who the people greatly feared. Every night, a terrible red mist would seep into the villages, and some poor soul would vanish without a trace—another life lost to Vladimir's growing appetites. Kevin M.

Connolly Unknown artist Vandal Loot eligible Legacy Blood Lord View in 3D 1820 21.11.2011 Former leader of a Bloodstone cult, Vladimir took part in a ritual that sacrificed his humanity—along with the blood of several victims—to transform the once foppish noble into a terror of the night. To satiate his sanguine cravings, he stalks the urban labyrinth in search of hapless prey.

Kevin M. Connolly Sixmorevodka Studio Academy Loot eligible Dark Waters View in 3D 1350 31.05.2018 In his younger days, Vladimir practiced at a school of medicine known for magically manipulating the humors of a patient's body.

Though he is not above helping someone for the right price, like that "idiot" Rakan, he has no stake in the war beyond finding the fabled well of Aspira within the congregation. Such power, he smugly reasons, would surely be better in his hands. Kevin M.
