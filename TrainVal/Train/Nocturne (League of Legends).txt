Against minions , Umbra Blade's damage to secondary targets and healing are reduced by 50% and it applies on-hit effects (bug) to all targets at 100% effectiveness. Umbra Blades can critically strike against the primary target, modifying the physical damage dealt to 「 (192. 5 % + 44% ) AD . 」 「 110% of the critical damage of his basic attacks. 」 Basic attacks reduce Umbra Blades' cooldown by 1 second, increased to 3 against enemy champions and monsters . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked The primary target of the enhanced attack takes basic damage while the secondary targets of the slash are dealt default damage . The enhanced attack will apply other on-hit effects (only to main target) and can critically strike as normal. The critical strike damage of the attack is notably unusual. (bug) It stems from a time where critical strikes by default did 200% AD damage, which meant that 110% of it equaled 220% AD , equal to a more standard Umbral Blades' bonus damage of 20% AD added to the critical damage. This also causes bonus critial damage such as Infinity Edge's passive to be 10% stronger on the attack. Now, the formula reduces the expected critical damage slightly by -2. 5 % AD , which is 10% of the reduction in base critical damage from Pre-Season 11 . The empowered attack will not trigger against structures nor wards . Basic attacks against them will still grant the cooldown reduction. Parry effects will only block the damage dealt to the primary target. Edit Duskbringer Duskbringer COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 8 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 1200 EFFECT RADIUS: 150 WIDTH: 120 SPEED: 1600 Active: Nocturne casts out a shadow blade in the target direction that leaves a Dusk Trail in its wake, dealing physical damage to enemies hit. Enemy champions and large monsters hit will leave a Dusk Trail behind while moving. Dusk Trails last 5 seconds and will slowly disappear afterwards. Physical damage: 65 / 110 / 155 / 200 / 245 (+ 85% bonus AD) While on the Dusk Trail , Nocturne is ghosted and gains bonus attack damage and bonus total movement speed . Bonus Attack Damage: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 Bonus Movement Speed: 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35% Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Duskbringer checks for and hits targets 25 units outside of the missile's maximum range. Duskbringer's damage is not increased by the bonus AD gained from its trail, meaning that casting it again while on the trail from the last cast will not result in higher damage. It is observed from seasons ago that this is intentionally hard-coded into the ability to avoid the projectile increasing its own damage. This feature is somewhat deprecated as it also limits chain-casting Duskbringer . Duskbringer's Dusk Trail will expose the path of affected units until its duration ends. It is a form of obscured vision ; the trail indirectly reveals the location of enemy units even in the fog of war, including those shrouded by stealth . Spell shield will block the damage and also prevents the Dusk Trail from following the target. The formed Dusk Trail does not disappear if Duskbringer is intercepted by Wind Wall or Unbreakable . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. The bonus movement speed stacks multiplicatively with other sources of movement speed boosts. Edit Shroud of Darkness Shroud of Darkness COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 CAST TIME: none Passive: Nocturne gains bonus attack speed . Bonus Attack Speed: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Enhanced Bonus Attack Speed: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100% Active: Nocturne gains a spell shield for 1. 5 seconds. Upon successfully blocking a hostile effect, Shroud of Darkness' bonus attack speed is doubled for 5 seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto If Shroud of Darkness is active when Nocturne re-casts Paranoia to dash to a target, its duration is refreshed every 0. 25 seconds during the dash. Edit Unspeakable Horror Unspeakable Horror COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 mana COOLDOWN: 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 425 EFFECT RADIUS: 1000 TETHER RADIUS: 465 Passive: Nocturne gains 90% bonus movement speed while facing nearby feared targets. Active: Nocturne torments the target, forming a tether between himself and the target for 2 seconds, during which the target takes magic damage every 0. 5 seconds over the duration. Total Magic Damage: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 100% AP) Magic Damage per Tick: 20 / 31. 25 / 42. 5 / 53. 75 / 65 (+ 25% AP) If the tether is not broken by the end of its duration, the target is feared for a duration while being slowed by 90%. Disable Duration: 1. 25 / 1. 5 / 1. 75 / 2 / 2. 25 Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro DOT damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Not Blocked Feared enemies in a 180° total angle within Nocturne's facing direction will trigger Unspeakable Horror's passive. The movement speed buff is granted even while Nocturne is standing still. Nocturne does not need to have sight of fleeing targets to gain movement speed towards them. Spell shield will block the tether's application but not the damage and aftereffects of one already applied. Edit Paranoia Paranoia COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 140 / 115 / 90 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 2500 / 3250 / 4000 EFFECT RADIUS: Global SPEED: 1800 Sight Reduction: 300 Active: Nocturne terrorizes all enemy champions, nearsighting them for 6 seconds. He can recast Paranoia for the same duration after 0. 25 seconds. Recast: Nocturne dashes with displacement immunity to the target enemy champion, dealing physical damage upon arrival. Physical Damage: 150 / 275 / 400 (+ 120% bonus AD) Nocturne can cast any of his abilities during the dash. Link ▶️ "Darkness... " Link ▶️ Activation alert. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto / Unit Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked See Notes Not Interrupted Nocturne will track the target if they change locations. He will dash to the target's previous location without dealing damage if the target is too far away or moves beyond 3500 / 4250 / 5000 (based on Paranoia's rank) units. Paranoia's nearsight will apply to enemy champions that are untargetable or are dead, and will persist through death . Nocturne can cast any of his abilities , summoner spells (excluding Hexflash ), or item actives during flight. Using a dash or blink ability will interrupt the flight. The flight will also be interrupted if Nocturne is affected by a Blast Cone triggered by an allied champion. (bug) Paranoia cannot be recast while grounded or rooted . Paranoia's nearsight does not apply to clones . Players' screens will turn a different color when Paranoia is cast, based on their perspective: blue for allies and red for enemies. A spell indicator telegraphed to Nocturne and his allies will be placed on all enemy champions within range of Paranoia's recast while the ability is active. The following images display the indicator for the default skin : A glowing red silhouette of Nocturne's blades indicates an enemy champion can be targeted by Paranoia's recast. A glowing green silhouette of Nocturne's blades signifies an enemy champion has been targeted by Paranoia's recast. Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins.

Original View in 3D 880 15.03.2011 A demonic amalgamation drawn from the nightmares that haunt every sentient mind, the thing known as Nocturne has become a primordial force of pure evil. It is liquidly chaotic in aspect, a faceless shadow with cold eyes and armed with wicked-looking blades. After freeing itself from the spirit realm, Nocturne descended upon the waking world, to feed upon the kind of terror that can only thrive in true darkness.

A clandestine experiment to fuse Hextech with demonic energies wrought a living nightmare, a predator rumored to stalk the streets and back alleyways of the city. Authorities report that any such creation would have been terminated along with any such project, and that any missing persons reports are, of course, completely unrelated.

Within the catacombs, they jealously guard the vast well of Aspira the congregation has filled over the centuries, toiling away at the unholy weapon that will destroy the Neverghaast once and for all.

Nocturne comes from the French nocturne , which is derived from the Latin nocturnus "of the night". Umbra Blades is named after Latin umbra for shade or shadow. Nocturne was the first champion to be previewed at a major event prior to release ( PAX East 2011). He was also previewed in IGN .
