Wolf is the secondary one acting as an untargetable companion commanded through abilities. Abilities [ ] Edit Mark of the Kindred Mark of the Kindred TARGET IMMUNITY : 240 Innate: Both Lamb and Wolf mark targets to hunt . Scoring a takedown against a hunted target collects a stack of Mark of the Kindred . Mark of the Kindred: Lamb gains 75 − 250 (based on marks) bonus range on her basic attacks and Mounting Dread . Innate - Lamb: Lamb is offered a selection of enemy champions to hunt if she has not been in combat with them in the last 6 seconds. Once selected, the mark is applied after an 8-second delay and thereafter it can be collected by Kindred . Lamb gains the ability to select a new target every 75 seconds. Targets successfully hunted cannot be marked again for 4 minutes. Innate - Wolf: Starting at 3:15 , Wolf periodically marks a random large monster within the enemy team's jungle for 180 seconds. The hunted camp is highlighted on the mini map to both teams. Once the hunted target is slain or the mark expires, Wolf will wait 45 seconds before selecting a new target. The type of monster that Wolf can mark changes based on Kindred's current Mark of the Kindred stacks: 0 : Rift Scuttler 1 – 3: Rift Scuttler , Crimson Raptor , Gromp 4 – 7: Ancient Krug , Blue Sentinel , Greater Murk Wolf , or Red Brambleback 8 + : Rift Herald or Baron Nashor , Dragon or Elder Dragon Link ▶️ "Our mark looms over you." Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Takedowns on monsters occur if Kindred had damaged them within the last 6 seconds. This only includes if the monster was slain by Kindred or an ally. Only killing the large monster is required to claim Wolf's mark. Gaining stacks from champions that would change what constitutes as a valid target for Wolf will not affect Kindred's ability to claim Wolf's current target. Wolf cannot mark monsters that have been slain, even if Kindred's team doesn't know that the camp has been slain. Wolf's cooldown is not displayed in-game. Combined with the above point and the target restrictions, Wolf may go extended periods of time without seeming to do anything. Wolf's marked target will always have its mark removed from the map 15 seconds after dying for both teams, regardless of whether they have vision of it or not. Map-Specific Differences Nexus Blitz differences edit Removed: Jungle camps are no longer marked. On-champion-kill stacks changed to 2. New Effect: Now always grant a stack when killing the Blue Sentinel , Red Brambleback or Rift Herald . Arena differences edit New Effect: Gains 1 Mark of the Kindred stack per round. Edit Dance of Arrows Dance of Arrows COST: 35 Mana COOLDOWN: 9 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 300 EFFECT RADIUS: Kindred's attack range SPEED: 500 + 100% movement speed Active: Lamb dashes toward the target location, gaining 35% (+ 5% per mark ) bonus attack speed for 4 seconds and firing an arrow at up to 3 nearby visible enemies that deals physical damage . Her current attack target within any proximity will be prioritized by one of the arrows. Physical Damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 75% bonus AD) Dance of Arrows' total cooldown is reduced to an amount while Lamb is within the area of Wolf's Frenzy . Casting Wolf's Frenzy reduces Dance of Arrows' current cooldown to the same amount. Static Cooldown: 4 / 3. 5 / 3 / 2. 5 / 2 Dance of Arrows resets Lamb's basic attack timer. Lamb can cast any of her abilities during the dash. Dance of Arrows will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Location Insufficient dash range Dash will gain bonus range through terrain. Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded Blocked Blocked Disabled Knockdown Interrupted The dash distance can be extended to up to 400 units when dashing across terrain. The cooldown will not be modified if it cannot be reduced (the current cooldown would have to be less than the reduction amount in this case). Map-Specific Differences Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit Cooldown while in Wolf's Frenzy set to 0. 5 seconds. * Edit Wolf's Frenzy Wolf's Frenzy COST: 40 Mana COOLDOWN : 18 / 17 / 16 / 15 / 14 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 500 EFFECT RADIUS: 800 SPEED: 1400 Passive: As Kindred move and attack, they build up to 100 stacks of Hunter's Vigor . At maximum stacks, Lamb's next basic attack heals her for 0% − 100% (based on Kindred's missing health) of 47 − 81 (based on level) . The heal is not triggered if Kindred is at full health. Active: Wolf dashes to the target location, then claims the surrounding area as his territory for the next 8. 5 seconds, separating from Lamb . He automatically attacks the closest nearby visible enemy within the area, prioritizing the last enemy Lamb has attacked, then enemy champions, then non-champions. Wolf's attacks deal magic damage and scale with 25% of Kindred's bonus attack speed . Against monsters, his attacks deal 150% damage and slow the target by 50% for 2 seconds. Magic Damage: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 (+ 20% bonus AD) (+ 20% AP) (+ 1. 5 % (+ 1% per mark ) of target's current health) Monster Damage: 37. 5 / 45 / 52. 5 / 60 / 67. 5 (+ 30% bonus AD) (+ 30% AP) (+ 2. 25 % (+ 1. 5 % per mark ) of target's current health) Wolf's Frenzy ends immediately if Lamb leaves the area or dies. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Wolf is untargetable and ghosted but he cannot move through terrain other than the initial dash on activation. Wolf is not able to re-target Rift Scuttler if he loses sight of her while he's attacking it. Wolf's Frenzy does not end if Lamb enters resurrection . Wolf's Frenzy applies ability haste to its cooldown post-effect. Given a base cooldown of 14 seconds at rank 5 with 100 ability haste, casting the ability and then ending it after 4 seconds will result in a remaining cooldown of ( 14 − 4 ) × 0.5 = 5 {\displaystyle (14 - 4) \times 0.5 = 5} seconds, where 0.5 is derived from ability haste . Because of this, there will always be some cooldown time remaining post-effect regardless of the amount of ability haste, unlike certain other abilities with cooldowns that start on-cast. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30. Bonus AD ratio changed to 10% bonus AD . Health ratio changed to 1% of target's current health . Damage per mark changed to 0. 5 %. Edit Mounting Dread Mounting Dread COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 500 − 750 (based on Marks) Active: Lamb fires a shot at the target enemy that slows them by 30% (+ 5% per 100 AP) for 1 second and marks them for 4 seconds. Her basic attacks against the marked target each apply a stack , refreshing the duration and stacking up to 3 times. The third stack directs Wolf to pounce on the target, consuming all stacks to deal additional physical damage , capped at 300 against monsters . Additional Physical Damage: 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 / 160 (+ 80% bonus AD) (+ 5% (+ 0. 5 % per Mark ) of target's missing health) Enhanced damage below threshold: 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 / 160 (+ 80% bonus AD) (+ 7. 5 % (+ 2. 25 %) (+ 0. 75 % (+ 0. 175 %) per Mark ) of target's missing health) The additional damage will critically strike against targets below 25% − 75% (based on critical strike chance) of their maximum health , increasing the missing health portion by (50% + 40% ) , and cannot critically strike otherwise. The base damage of the pounce can independently critically strike . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Blocked Blocked Blocked Guinsoo's Rageblade does not prevent the additional damage from critically striking . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel and not pay its cost but still go on cooldown . (bug) This ability cannot be cast on a target with Mounting Dread stacks. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base health ratio changed to 2% of target's missing health . Edit Lamb's Respite Lamb's Respite COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 180 / 150 / 120 CAST TIME: None EFFECT RADIUS: 535 Active: Lamb blesses the ground under herself for 4 seconds and enters a 0. 264 seconds cast time . All units inside the zone gain a minimum health threshold of 10% of their maximum health , and will become invulnerable for the remaining duration when they reach or are at the threshold, during which they also cannot be healed , but can still regenerate health . All targetable units within the zone are healed when the blessing ends. Heal: 225 / 300 / 375 Link ▶️ "Shine once more, before the end." Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Lamb's Respite will affect all champions , minions , and monsters , but not wards , turrets , or jungle plants . Lamb's Respite will affect untargetable units but does not grant them the heal at the end of the blessing. It will specifically not affect champions that are resurrecting from Guardian Angel . Health costs will ignore Lamb's Respite's threshold. The cost will not be paid if the caster is below the threshold. Lamb's Respite has no effect on zombie state or clone units. The effects are applied before the cast time. Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins. For all associated collection items, see Kindred (Collection) . Original View in 3D 880 13.10.2015 Separate, but never parted, Kindred represents the twin essences of death. Lamb’s bow offers a swift release from the mortal realm for those who accept their fate. Wolf hunts down those who run from their end, delivering violent finality within his crushing jaws. Though interpretations of Kindred’s nature vary across Runeterra, every mortal must choose the true face of their death. Marcella Lentz-Pope, Matthew Mercer Evan 'Somnicidal' Monteiro Loot eligible Shadowfire View in 3D 1350 13.10.2015 When the Ashen Lord rose, high priests of the Shadowfire Temple called upon their own god to fend off the all-consuming Infernals. They neglected, however, to account for the being's twin aspects: Destruction, and Rebirth. Kindred will fight the flames, but there may be a bitter price to pay before the end… Marcella Lentz-Pope, Matthew Mercer Jean 'Curing' Go Infernal Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Super Galaxy View in 3D 1350 25.05.2016 Lamb joined the Super Galaxy team as its lead scout, venturing into uncharted territory to face all manner of alien dangers. Soon after, Wolf joined the team as Lamb's partner—though, in truth, he only really joined because she still owes him for lunch, back when they were cadets. She's not getting away this time! Marcella Lentz-Pope, Matthew Mercer Christian Fell Super Galaxy Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Spirit Blossom View in 3D 1350 06.08.2020 In the Ionian tradition, the Kindred are interpreted as a child and her beastly companion, endlessly playing games with one another until they are called to perform their duties.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Kindred is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect: Aurelion Sol , Bard , Bel'Veth , Cho'Gath , Draven , Nasus , Senna , Shyvana , Sion , Smolder , Swain , Sylas , Thresh , and Veigar . In Kindred's case, Mark of the Kindred infinitely stacks the bonus attack speed of Dance of Arrows , magic damage of Wolf's Frenzy and bonus physical damage of Mounting Dread . Kindred is the first champion to not have their icon derived from their artwork (considering theirs is a two-for-one case) as well as the first whose release was celebrated with summoner icons (one for Lamb and one for Wolf). Kindred's dance references the 'Cups' tap dance performed by Christopher Rice. [2] A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. In the classic splash art, Lamb's hand has 4 fingers (with a possible hidden thumb) while in-game and in Super Galaxy Kindred's splash art she has 3 fingers.
