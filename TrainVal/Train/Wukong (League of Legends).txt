Original View in 3D 880 26.07.2011 Wukong is a vastayan trickster who uses his strength, agility, and intelligence to confuse his opponents and gain the upper hand. After finding a lifelong friend in the warrior known as Master Yi, Wukong became the last student of the ancient martial art known as Wuju. Armed with an enchanted staff, Wukong seeks to prevent Ionia from falling to ruin. Spike Spencer Christian Fell Loot eligible Volcanic View in 3D 975 26.07.2011 A greater Infernal whose power is drawn from the molten rock bubbling beneath the earth, Wukong's rage causes mountains to split, lava to rain from the sky, and rivers to become blackened glass. Still, he will never back down from any challenge—and this, perhaps, will be the key to his defeat. Spike Spencer Unknown artist Infernal Loot eligible General View in 3D 750 26.07.2011 Once a mischievous scout, Wukong led his sworn brethren on a treacherous journey to the western hinterlands, where he attained martial enlightenment. Now promoted to the rank of general, he commands a host of fearsome warriors, destined to cleanse the realm of monsters and demons alike. Spike Spencer Zhou Juexian Legacy Loot eligible Jade Dragon View in 3D 975 10.01.2012 Imbued with the power of the legendary jade dragon, Wukong has honed his abilities to a razor sharp point.Though still headstrong and brash, his newfound power is undeniable—a worrying sign to his master, as the jade dragon carries a powerful curse... Spike Spencer Unknown artist Lunar Revel Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Chromas Jade Dragon Wukong Chromas Meteorite Underworld View in 3D 1350 28.10.2014 Once a pupil of the martial arts, Wukong trained under his masters' strict traditions and doctrines. In him, Death saw limitless potential, and chose to claim the disregarded student for the underworld instead. Now, Wukong fights alongside the undying hordes, no longer bound by the rules of the living. Spike Spencer Sperasoft Studio Death Sworn Loot eligible Legacy Voice filter Additional/unique quotes New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Radiant View in 3D 1350 27.01.2016 An ascendant being of nearly limitless power, Radiant Wukong has undertaken a great journey to test his skills against history's greatest warriors. However, overcoming his quick temper and impulsive nature might be his greatest challenge yet. Spike Spencer Sixmorevodka Studio Lunar Revel Loot eligible Voice filter Additional/unique quotes New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Lancer Stratus View in 3D 1350 04.04.2018 Another of the ancient, mechanized Lancer units, Wukong arises from his dusty slumber in times of extreme danger, protecting the outland city-states from the most dire threats. Once these foes are eliminated he returns to the earth, an enigma older than recorded history. Spike Spencer Bo 'chenbowow' Chen Lancer Loot eligible Voice filter Additional/unique quotes New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Battle Academia View in 3D 1350 18.03.2021 A consummate troublemaker and prankster, Wukong has failed out of every high school in the region, eventually washing out into Labrys as an 'enrollment of last resort'. A naturally gifted fighter in the Battle Club, he still hasn't learned discipline, and only listens to Caitlyn because she can beat him up. Spike Spencer Ina Wong, West Studio Battle Academia Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Battle Academia Wukong Chromas Catseye Emerald Meteorite Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Elderwood View in 3D 1350 28.06.2023 A protector with no one left to protect, Wukong torments any creatures who dare traverse within the Elderwood's depths. After the Coven destroyed his village in search of his enchanted staff's limitless power, he learned that trust is a fool's luxury. The gleam from his weapon's crystals serve as a constant reminder of the ancient trickster's failure. Spike Spencer Ina Wong, West Studio Elderwood Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Elderwood Wukong Chromas Amethyst Aquamarine Citrine Emerald Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Wukong is based on Sun Wukong from the Chinese novel Journey to the West . Coincidentally, much of Garen's kit was a possible basis for Wukong, mainly due to both characters having: A "Q" ability that originally stated its scaling to be over 100% in attack damage as an auto-attack booster and reset with an extra effect ( Decisive Strike silences with a movement speed boost while Wukong's Crushing Blow reduces armor by a percentage), and applies on-hit effects as well. A passive ability that increases their defensive stats (with Garen's being a normal ability with not only percentage defensive boosts, but also with a damage reduction active while Wukong's only being a standard passive with flat defense/HP boosts). Point-and-click spells; Garen's can only target one champion with it and acts as his ultimate; Wukong's can hit two extra targets in range, moves him to said target(s) and acts as a normal ability. Both versions at some point have interacted with magic damage ( Garen's Demacian Justice originally inflicted bonus magic damage while Wukong's Nimbus Strike now scales with magic damage and ability power as of his gameplay update). Cyclone and Judgment involve a very similar spinning animation and near-identical mechanics in the way their hits are racked up, how they provide bonus movement speed during cast time, and cancellation. A number of certain item actives and summoner spells can even be used during their cast times, though depending on the champion there are exclusive item actives only available to them during such abilities, as Wukong before his update could not activate Tiamat's / Ravenous Hydra's active during Cyclone . Cyclone also cannot critically strike, unlike Judgment . Likewise, both their ultimates ( Demacian Justice and Cyclone ) have HP-based-damage-scaling against their targets. The name of Cyclone on the Chinese Servers, 大鬧天宮 ( trad. ) 大闹天宫 ( simpl. ) ( Dànào Tiāngōng , lit. Greatly Wrecking the Heavenly Palace ) references the Monkey King's rebellion against the Jade Emperor & other heavenly government's officials, until Buddha sealed him the Five Finger Mountain ( Wǔzhǐshān , 五指山) for five centuries, before embarking on his westward journey to redeem himself. [2] Other MOBA's than League of Legends (such as Heroes of Newerth [3] , Smite [4] , and Dota 2 [5] ) also feature a character based on Sun Wukong. These expies of the Monkey King (including Smite's pre-worked Sun Wukong ) have similar abilities and playstyles (mainly being damaging tanks with assassin potential, and having very unique tricks with their abilities). Wukong is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin. When he uses Warrior Trickster , his clone will be of a different colour palette which can only be seen by Wukong and his allies. To the opposing team, the two Wukongs look exactly the same, including copies of any external buffs and item effects active at the moment the clone is spawned (Prior to patch V5.22 , clones did not duplicate external buff/active item effect particles). Four other champions with this feature are LeBlanc (via Mirror Image ), Shaco's (via Hallucinate ), Nasus (via Fury of the Sands ) and Malphite (via Granite Shield and Thunderclap ). Wukong's critical strike animation is a possible nod to a famous pole-vaulting kick used by many incarnations of the original Sun Wukong, especially in the TV drama adaptations of Journey to the West , and his Warriors Orochi / Musou Orochi incarnation as well. When a Wukong Bot uses Warrior Trickster , the decoy is named "MonkeyKing Bot". Wukong is the only champion with two Lunar Revel skins. Before his gameplay update, Cyclone was originally tied as one of the highest AD ratio abilities in the game.
