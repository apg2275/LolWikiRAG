Strategy Spellbinder is strong in the early game, especially on AP assassins such as Evelynn . This is because it offers an active that greatly increases their output damage, which is most effective in early game as the AP boost is flat. Having a spammable ability ( Evelynn's Hate Spike ) is helpful in racking up stacks through self-charges. Shapeshifting (as in stance shifts like Nidalee's Aspect of the Cougar ), ability reactivations or toggles will not count towards Spellsteal . Trivia The item's icon is a recolor of Globe of Trust .
