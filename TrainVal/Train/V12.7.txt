Clash Team formation for the Clash Piltover Cup begins on April 11, and the tournament begins on April 16 and 17.

Ranked 2022 Split 2 The second Split of Ranked begins on Friday, April 22 at 11:59 PM local time for your region. The exclusive rewards for Split 2 are a Renata Glasc summoner icon, Renata Glasc emotes, 1 Renata Glasc Champion permanent, and a Series 1 Eternals Capsule. Mythic Content Overhaul [ ] Masterwork Milestones Start of phase 2: introducing an infinitely repeatable rewards track for Masterwork Chests. Any Masterwork Chest you open grants progress on the rewards track, regardless of whether you bought it, earned it as a reward, or received it as a gift. In addition, since we've adjusted random Mythic Essence drops from Masterwork chests from 10 ME to 5 ME, we won't revert last patch's buff to ME, it'll remain at a 4.2% drop rate. 5 Masterwork Chests: 5 ME and one skin shard of any tier. 10 Masterwork Chests: 5 ME. 15 Masterwork Chests: 5 ME and one 975 + tier skin shard. 20 Masterwork Chests: 5 ME. 25 Masterwork Chests: 5 ME and one 1350 + tier skin shard. Also introducing two adjustments to the Masterwork system relative to the original plan. Our original model would've led to Masterwork Chests granting more Mythic Essence than the new system has been tuned to support. Removed: Masterwork Chests no longer have a 10% chance to drop a bonus Masterwork Chest and Hextech Key. Random Mythic Essence drops from Masterwork Chests reduced to 5 ME from 10 ME. Hextech Chests still drop 10 ME. The above changes mean we no longer need to revert last patch's buff to Mythic Essence drop rates from Masterwork Chests (4.2%, up from 3.6%).
