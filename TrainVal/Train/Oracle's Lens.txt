Players erroneously assuming that if the drone doesn't reveal anything in a brush that there isn't anything in the brush is currently working in the favour of Vision Wards, which are going undetected for longer periods of time than they might do otherwise. With the removal of Oracle's Elixir , Oracle's Lens is now the only item that grants True Sight on Summoner's Rift.
