Orientalis , referring the rising sun. Aurum " gold "; which she shares with Aurelion Sol . Orianna was the last champion priced lower than 6300 on release. Clockwork Winding is named after and references the eponymous gear mechanism . Orianna's icon during her 'Champion Spotlight' was a walfas-styled face. Multiple miniature copies of The Ball can be seen on Corporate Mundo's desk during the game's Mac Version trailer. In the now-removed official League of Legends forums , the icon of Command: Shockwave was used to represent the "Forum Games" section.
