Astral Flight : Range is increased by 62. 5 % Stardust stacks . Singularity : Outer and inner radius increased by 15% Stardust stacks , and execution threshold increased by 2. 6 % Stardust stacks . Falling Star and The Skies Descend : Effect radius increased by 15% Stardust stacks . Breath of Light (Q) Active: Aurelion Sol charges for up to 3. 25 seconds to exhale a beam of starfire, during which he can steer the beam in the target direction. The beam collides with the first enemy hit, reveals them, and deals them 3. 75 − 11. 25 (based on level) (+ 1. 875 / 3. 125 / 4. 375 / 5. 625 / 6. 875 ) (+ 7. 5 % AP) magic damage every 0. 125 seconds, reduced to 50% for other surrounding enemies hit by the beam. Breath of Light can be recast within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards. For each second that the beam continuously damages the same enemy, it bursts to deal 20 − 40 (based on level) (+ 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80) (+ 50% AP) (+ (0. 031 % Stardust stacks) of target's maximum health) bonus magic damage and grants 1 Stardust if the target is a champion .

Astral Flight can be recast after 0. 5 seconds during the dash, and does so automatically after reaching the destination. Recast: Aurelion Sol ends Astral Flight early. Scoring a champion takedown within 3 seconds of damaging them reduces Astral Flight's current cooldown by 90% of its total cooldown.
