Edit Plasma Fission Plasma Fission COST: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 Mana COOLDOWN : 7 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 1100 / 1100 WIDTH: 100 / 90 SPEED: 1300 / 2100 Active: Vel'Koz fires a plasma bolt in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first enemy hit and slows them by 70% decaying over a duration. Plasma Fission can be recast after 0. 25 seconds while the bolt is in flight, and does so automatically upon hitting an enemy or maximum range. Magic Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 90% AP) Slow Duration: 1 / 1. 4 / 1. 8 / 2. 2 / 2. 6 Recast: Vel'Koz splits the bolt in two over 0. 25 seconds , each part firing perpendicularly in opposite directions and applying the same effects to enemies hit. Whenever Plasma Fission kills an enemy, Vel'Koz restores mana . Mana Restored per Kill: 20 / 22. 5 / 25 / 27. 5 / 30 Maximum Mana Restored: 60 / 67. 5 / 75 / 82. 5 / 90 Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction / Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Detonating the ability manually does not. An enemy cannot be hit by multiple bolts even when having blocked one with a spell shield . The split occurs at a location 55 units in front of the primary bolt's final location. Plasma Fission can reach a maximum 1595 units diagonally (ignoring the split missile's width and enemy hitbox radius), reaching this distance after a total of about ~1. 65 seconds. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Edit Void Rift Void Rift COST: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana + 1 Charge CAST TIME: none STATIC COOLDOWN: 1. 5 RECHARGE: 19 / 18 / 17 / 16 / 15 RANGE: 1105 / 1105 / -95 WIDTH: 175 / 175 SPEED: 1700 Active: Vel'Koz cracks a rift in the target direction that opens after a 0. 25 -second delay, cascading through the area over 0. 65 seconds to deal magic damage to enemies within. Magic Damage: 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 (+ 20% AP) After 0. 75 seconds , the rift violently collapses, dealing magic damage to enemies within and granting sight of the surrounding area for 0. 25 seconds. Magic Damage: 45 / 75 / 105 / 135 / 165 (+ 25% AP) Total Magic Damage: 75 / 125 / 175 / 225 / 275 (+ 45% AP) Vel'Koz periodically stocks a Void Rift charge, up to a maximum of 2. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes See Notes Unbreakable and Wind Wall will block the ripple and prevent the rift from forming further, but they will not destroy the section that was created already. Spell shield only blocks one instance of damage. Edit Tectonic Disruption Tectonic Disruption COST: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana COOLDOWN: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 800 EFFECT RADIUS: 225 Active: Vel'Koz hurls a disruptive anomaly that lands to the target location after 0. 25 − 0. 5 (based on cast distance) seconds, dealing magic damage to enemies hit and knocking them up and stunning them for 0. 75 seconds, as well as granting sight of the area briefly. Magic Damage: 70 / 100 / 130 / 160 / 190 (+ 30% AP) If Tectonic Disruption is cast in close proximity of Vel'Koz , the anomaly will also slightly knock back enemies hit in the direction of the cast. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked See Notes The required proximity for the knock back is relative to Vel'Koz's position when casting and not his current one. While the effect is fully prevented by blocking the missile (e.g. with Unbreakable and Wind Wall ), the missile may not be destroyed visually . (bug) The area of effect indicator appears at the end of the cast time. It will persist even if the cast cancels (e.g. Vel'Koz dies before cast time completes) despite the projectile not firing. Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun . Edit Life Form Disintegration Ray Life Form Disintegration Ray COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: none RANGE: 1555 WIDTH: 175 Passive - Researched: Applying 3 Deconstruction stacks to an enemy champion marks them as Researched for 7 seconds, refreshing on basic attacks and ability hits against them. Active: After a 0. 2 -second delay, Vel'Koz channels for up to 2. 6 seconds to project an energy beam, during which he can steer the beam in the target direction. Life Form Disintegration Ray can be recast after 1 second during the channel, and does so automatically after the duration. The beam deals magic damage to enemies hit every 0. 2 seconds, and slows them by 20%, lingering for 1 second. Deconstruction is applied every 0. 7 seconds to enemies hit. Researched enemies take true damage instead. Damage Per Tick: 34. 62 / 48. 08 / 61. 54 (+ 9. 62 % AP) Maximum Damage: 450 / 625 / 800 (+ 125% AP) Recast: Vel'Koz ends Life Form Disintegration Ray . Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Magic / True Counters Projectile Disruption Not Blocked Interrupted Life Form Disintegration Ray's direction updates gradually (moving the cursor from one side of Vel'Koz to the other will not make him rotate instantly). Vel'Koz will reveal himself if the ray is near an enemy champion. The beam hits in a rectangular shape, intersecting with the edge of an enemy gameplay radius . Because of this, the effect will hit enemies whose center location is to the sides and/or slightly behind Vel'Koz, as long as their radius intersects with the area.

Original View in 3D 880 27.02.2014 It is unclear if Vel’Koz was the first Voidborn to emerge on Runeterra, but there has certainly never been another to match his level of cruel, calculating sentience. While his kin devour or defile everything around them, he seeks instead to scrutinize and study the physical realm—and the strange, warlike beings that dwell there—for any weakness the Void might exploit. But Vel’Koz is far from a passive observer, striking back at threats with deadly plasma, or by disrupting the very fabric of the world itself. Erik Braa Christian Fell, Alex 'alexplank' Flores Loot eligible Battlecast View in 3D 1350 27.02.2014 An airborne data collection unit based on the now-extinct Vel'Koz lifeform, these Battlecast monstrosities sweep their concentrated energy beams over heavily populated areas. Survey data from the lifeless wreckage automatically calibrates the entire fleets' weapons systems, making the units a deadlier threat with every skirmish.

Once every millenium he descends to the mortal plane, choosing those worthy enough to carry out his inscrutable will, and transforming them into creatures of transcendent power—the Arclight.

What is known, however, is that this cataclysmic titan can level entire civilizations with his incinerating gaze, leaving only smouldering ruin. Woe be to those fixed in the behemoth's infernal gaze, for there will be no remains left to bury.

Vel'Koz's taunt is Schrödinger's equation written in Visitor language from V by Kenneth Johnson . Vel'Koz is based on the Oculothorax archetype, with one of these in particular ( Shuma-Gorath from Marvel Comics ) used as the basis for Life Form Disintegration Ray . Vel'Koz's personality might have been based on the amoral Decepticon scientist Shockwave , from the Transformers franchise. Shockwave's head consists mostly of his single glaring eye, which might also have inspired Vel'Koz. Vel'Koz had his game assets reused for several featured game modes . He was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Shooty Eyeball Monster" (along with its huge variant) in Invasion . His animations were reused for the Landsquid and Squidtooth monsters in Odyssey: Extraction . Life Form Disintegration Ray is the longest ability name at 29 characters long. For contrast, it is longer than Hop , the shortest ability name at 3 characters long, by 27 characters.
