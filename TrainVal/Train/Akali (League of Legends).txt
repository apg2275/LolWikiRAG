For 2 seconds, she gains 30 / 40 / 50 / 60% (based on level) bonus movement speed while moving away from the center of the ring. Only one ring may be active at a time. When Akali exits the ring, for 2 seconds, she regains the bonus movement speed while facing nearby enemy champions and becomes empowered with Swinging Kama for 4 seconds, during which she cannot create another ring. Swinging Kama: Akali's next basic attack is empowered to have its range doubled and deal 35 − 182 (based on level) (+ 60% bonus AD) (+ 55% AP) bonus magic damage . Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked Enemies cannot see the ring, but can see the empower effect. Swinging Kama gives a static bonus range which doesn't change if Akali's range changes during it (i.e Rapid Firecannon ): If Rapid Firecannon fully charges within Swinging Kama's duration, Akali's total range increases to 337.5 . If Rapid Firecannon fully charges before gaining Swinging Kama , Akali's total range is increased to 395 . The ring will be created around the last target hit by Five Point Strike . The ring's center is offset 120 units away from the enemy's center, towards Akali. The empowered attack can be dodged and blocked , and will be mitigated by blinds . The empowered attack will trigger but not be consumed nor apply its effects against structures and wards .

Due to any actions only starting on integer game ticks , the effective cast time rounds up to 0. 264 / 0. 231 / 0. 231 / 0. 198 (based on level) and the hit will occur at 0. 198 / 0. 198 / 0. 165 / 0. 132 (based on level) seconds into it.

Bonus AD ratio changed to 75% bonus AD . AP ratio changed to 60% AP . Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Akali_Q_Video.webm Edit Twilight Shroud Twilight Shroud COOLDOWN : 20 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 250 EFFECT RADIUS: 350 / 1175 Active: Akali restores 100 energy over 0. 4 seconds and gains bonus movement speed that decays over 2 seconds. She also detonates a smoke bomb a fixed distance away in the target direction, creating a circular shroud that expands over the next 5 seconds into a ring. The shroud does not permeate terrain, and will expand toward nearby enemy champions. While the shroud is active, Akali's maximum energy is increased by 100 . Bonus Movement Speed: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Shroud Duration: 5 / 5. 5 / 6 / 6. 5 / 7 Entering the shroud renders Akali invisible , unless she is dashing . Declaring a basic attack or casting an ability will break the invisibility and prevent Akali from entering it for 1 − 0. 625 (based on minutes) seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks and casts. The marked section of Twilight Shroud will linger for the mark's duration, even after the shroud ends. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Direction Akali will also not gain the invisibility if she is Recalling . It is possible for Akali to detonate the smoke bomb on the far side of terrain from her current location. The effects are applied before the cast time, and Akali can move during the cast time. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Energy restoration changed to 150. Cooldown changed to 10 seconds from 20.

Magic Damage: 30 / 56. 25 / 82. 5 / 108. 75 / 135 (+ 25. 5 % AD) (+ 36% AP) The shuriken marks and reveals the enemy or the last smoke section hit for 3 seconds, during which Shuriken Flip can be recast to consume the mark. Recast: Akali dashes towards the marked target or smoke section. Against enemies she deals magic damage upon arrival. Magic Damage: 70 / 131. 25 / 192. 5 / 253. 75 / 315 (+ 59. 5 % AD) (+ 84% AP) Total Magic Damage: 100 / 187. 5 / 275 / 362. 5 / 450 (+ 85% AD) (+ 120% AP) Akali will not flip backwards if she is immobilized or grounded during the cast time. Twilight Shroud and Perfect Execution can be cast during the recast's dash. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction / Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded Blocked Blocked Disabled Knockdown Interrupted Akali will track the target if they change locations. She will not stop tracking the target until she reaches them, as there is no maximum tracking distance. Both casts count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Shuriken Flip does not interrupt Akali's previous move or attack orders. The recast does. Shuriken Flip cannot be recast if the target is not visible or is untargetable . Akali will be ordered to basic attack the target after the recast's dash ends. Akali will dash backwards up-to 400 units in a straight line. This dash can cross terrain if the end point is beyond it. If she would end the dash inside terrain, she will instead look for a location  in either direction left or right that is outside of terrain and dash there. If there is no such location, she will dash only up to the wall at her normal speed, ending the dash early. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. The shuriken missile will fire from wherever Akali is at the end of the cast time (usually mid-dash), but always towards and reaching the location that was 825 units in front of her at the start of cast. The only exception is if she moves via Flash , in which case the range of the missile is decreased relative to the distance she blinked. Killing an enemy with the shuriken will still mark the last area of the shroud hit. Attempting to cast Five Point Strike during either dash will buffer it to cast as soon as the dash ends. Attacking Disabled Abilities Twilight Shroud is usable. Shuriken Flip is disabled for 10 seconds and then interrupts. Both dashes of Perfect Execution interrupt.

If this hits an enemy, she flips over them to continue the dash up to the normal range but for at least another 150 units. Magic Damage: 80 / 220 / 360 (+ 50% bonus AD) (+ 30% AP) Perfect Execution can be recast after a 2. 5 -second static cooldown within 10 seconds of the first activation. Recast: Akali dashes 800 units in the target direction, dealing magic damage to enemies she passes through, increased by 0% − 200% (based on target's missing health) .

Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Both casts count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. With the first cast, Akali can dash up to a maximum of 900 units if the first enemy she hit was at the maximum dash range. Casting Flash during either dashes will interrupt them, but Akali will deal damage to any enemies she comes in contact with at the new location. Enemies already hit by either of Perfect Execution's casts cannot be affected more than once by the same cast. Shuriken Flip can be used during the initial dash if it is cast after Perfect Execution's cast time finishes.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Akali, the Fist of Shadow Akali's dance referenced Single Ladies by Beyoncé . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Akali was the only energy-based champion to have any associated cost on their ultimate (one Essence of Shadow). Shadow Dance was going to be a skillshot but became single-targeted instead. Akali used to gain the 'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength' cosmetic Easter egg debuff ( "This unit is a flippin' ninja!" - "Ninjas are more effective when they work alone. For every Ninja on your team beyond yourself, you lose 1 health." ) when she, Kennen , Shen , and/or Zed found themselves on the same team. It was removed in V3.14 for unknown reasons. In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, the following change regarding Akali was jokingly listed： Akali is no longer a ninja. Akali, the Rogue Assassin Due to Japanese rhotacism , Akali may sound identical to Japanese 明かり akari " light , brightness, gleam", from Old Japanese stative verbal root *aka(-r-) "to be red, to be bright" (> aka(-i) 赤(い) "red") Akali is the second champion, after Yasuo , to have an emote that will orient itself the same (facing towards the camera), no matter what direction Akali was facing. However, she is the first to always reposition herself to face the camera when using the emotes, and has this function on both her dance and joke emotes. Akali's Series 1 Eternals make the following references: Check Marks references the eponymous symbol . Like a Ninja describes Shuriken Flip's mobility and use of shuriken , two features common in depictions of ninja in popular culture.
