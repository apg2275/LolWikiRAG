Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive No additional details. Edit Undertow Undertow COST: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana COOLDOWN : 9 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 425 / 1000 EFFECT RADIUS: 100 / 250 / 300 WIDTH: 180 SPEED: 1600 Active: Olaf throws an axe to the target location that deals physical damage to enemies it passes through and slows them for 1. 5 − 2. 5 (based on distance traveled) seconds. Enemy champions hit are also inflicted with 20% armor reduction for 4 seconds. Physical Damage: 65 / 115 / 165 / 215 / 265 (+ 100% bonus AD) Slow: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45% The axe remains in place for a duration equal to Undertow's cooldown, briefly granting sight of its surroundings. Olaf can pick up the axe to reduce Undertow's current cooldown to 2. 5 seconds , which resets the cooldown if that has already elapsed. Undertow will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Nearby monsters are granted ghosting upon Undertow's cast. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked See Notes Undertow may hit additional targets upon landing, but not targets already struck in-flight. The axe will land approximately 50 units further than Undertow's target range if cast below maximum range. The axe is stopped prematurely upon encountering Wind Wall or Unbreakable , remaining on the ground upon collision. The timer for how long an axe stays on the ground does not begin until it has landed, thus it is possible to throw another axe before retrieving the first. Olaf cannot pick up an enemy Olaf's axe on the ground. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Edit Tough It Out Tough It Out COST: 30 Mana COOLDOWN: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 CAST TIME: none Active: Olaf gains bonus attack speed for 4 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% He also grants himself a shield for 2. 5 seconds with an amount that is capped at 70% missing health . Shield Strength: 10 / 40 / 70 / 100 / 130 (+ 17. 5 % missing health) Tough It Out resets Olaf's basic attack timer. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto No additional details. Edit Reckless Swing Reckless Swing COST: 21 / 34. 5 / 48 / 61. 5 / 75 (+ 15% AD) Health COOLDOWN: 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 325 Active: Olaf strikes thunder onto the target enemy, dealing true damage . True Damage: 70 / 115 / 160 / 205 / 250 (+ 50% AD) If Reckless Swing kills the target, Olaf heals himself equal to the health cost . Basic attacks reduce Reckless Swing's cooldown by 1 second. Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage True Drawn Counters Spell shield Blocked The health cost is equal to 30% of the total damage dealt by the ability. Reckless Swing can be cast even if Olaf doesn't have the sufficient amount of health to pay for the health cost. As with all abilities with health costs, Reckless Swing will not reduce Olaf's health below 1 . Reckless Swing's health refund is considered a heal therefore it is affected by healing modifiers. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Edit Ragnarok Ragnarok COOLDOWN : 100 / 90 / 80 CAST TIME: none Passive: Olaf gains bonus armor and bonus magic resistance . Bonus Resistances: 10 / 20 / 30 Active: Olaf becomes enraged for 3 seconds, cleansing himself of all crowd control and becoming immune to them , as well as gaining bonus attack damage and 10% increased size . For the first second of Ragnarok , he also gains bonus movement speed while facing visible enemy champions within 2000 units. Bonus Attack Damage: 10 / 20 / 30 (+ 25% AD) Bonus Movement Speed: 20 / 45 / 70% Ragnarok's duration is increased by and up to 2. 5 seconds for each basic attack on-hit or cast of Reckless Swing against an enemy champion . Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Ragnarok removes the underlying stun from airborne effects, but not the forced displacement, which requires him to use a blink or dash ability to override it. Ragnarok does not bypass self or ally applied effects, unless otherwise stated. Some examples include Zhonya's Hourglass , Guardian Angel , and Fate's Call . He prevents both ally and enemy Bard from putting him in stasis with Tempered Fate . The ability will remain for its full duration regardless. Ragnarok does not negate any debuffs other than crowd control from being applied unless absolutely necessary. The bonus attack damage updates dynamically over the duration; Increases or reductions in attack damage after the effect has been applied will still be amplified. The 25% attack damage scaling amplifies the flat attack damage bonus as well. Ragnarok will not expire during Reckless Swing's cast time. Ragnarok will not resist the displacement caused by the 10 additional Blast Cones spawned by Infernal Rift if they're triggered by Olaf . (bug) Ragnarok's duration will not be increased if the basic attack is dodged . Ragnarok's duration will be increased if the basic attack is blocked .

Original View in 3D 790 08.06.2010 An unstoppable force of destruction, the axe-wielding Olaf wants nothing but to die in glorious combat. Hailing from the brutal Freljordian peninsula of Lokfar, he once received a prophecy foretelling his peaceful passing—a coward's fate, and a great insult among his people. Seeking death, and fueled by rage, he rampaged across the land, slaughtering scores of great warriors and legendary beasts in search of any opponent who could stop him. Now a brutal enforcer for the Winter's Claw, he seeks his end in the great wars to come.

Olaf the Berserker might be referencing Clerks . Olaf's dance references Technoviking . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Ragnarok is named after the eponymous events from Norse mythology . The symbol displayed in its icon is 力 (from Chinese, loaned into Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean: power ) while the crowd control removal references the Poetic Edda . During development he was simply called Enrage Barbarian . Olaf's name derives from Old West Norse ᚬᛚᛅᚠᛦ Óláfʀ , [2] . ​Many Vikings, Norse-Gaels, and Varangians bore this name and its derivatives. His title means "bear-sark" , referencing the garment worn by Norse berserkers . Since his lore-retconning, Olaf fears his prophesied death in peace & obscurity and instead longs for an unforgettable, glorious death in combat, inspired by the common Indo-European literary motif "Imperishable Glory". [3] Likewise, Pantheon challenges his opponent(s) into an epic battle. In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called "Urlaf" , referencing Urf .
