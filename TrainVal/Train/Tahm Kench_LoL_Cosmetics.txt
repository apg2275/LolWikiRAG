He is the second skin referencing the colorful carps nishigikoi (the first being Koi Nami ). When joking he will spit out a croissant , a piece of sushi , a cheeseburger , or a dumpling (among other things). He was inspired by Quina Quen from Final Fantasy IX , Adjudicator from Demon's Souls , Jiro Ono from Jiro Dreams of Sushi , and Iron Chef .
