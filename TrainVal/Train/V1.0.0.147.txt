General [ ] The time window for multikills has been increased to 10 seconds from the previous kills as opposed to 8. Spectator Mode [ ] Spectators can now rearrange the display positions of any player on the scoreboard in the bottom-center of the screen by dragging that player's bar. The scoreboard has been rearranged for easier team comparisons: Champion portraits have been moved to the center of the scoreboard, with minion kills immediately adjacent. Items are now automatically sorted to display more expensive items toward the center of the scoreboard. While drag-scrolling (default: middle mouse click + drag), the camera will now wait to move until the player drags the mouse, rather than automatically moving in the direction of the initial click. E.g. if a player middle-clicks the right side of the screen, the camera will no longer automatically move to the right. Instead, it will move based on where the player drags the mouse. Max scroll speed remains the same and caps out at a drag length equal to the distance between the center and edge of the screen. The mouse cursor will now disappear while drag-scrolling. New Elo Tiers [ ] Season 2 rewards will be earned based on the highest rating achieved between now and the end of the season. Click here to view the Season 2 rewards for the various tiers.

For example, a player might achieve Silver VI, then work their way up to Silver I, and then achieve Gold VI Click here to view the full breakdown of the new ranks. Medals in the summoner profile have been upgraded with completely new art. Earning a new rank will visually upgrade the profile medal.
