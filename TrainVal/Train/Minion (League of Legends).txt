For information about the species , see Minion (Species) . For information about the Legends of Runeterra card , see 2 Minion . Minions of League of Legends (by Riot Contracted Artist Marie Magny ) Minions are units that comprise the main force sent by the Nexus . They spawn periodically from their Nexus and advance along a lane towards the enemy Nexus, automatically engaging any enemy unit or structure they encounter. They are controlled by artificial intelligence and only use basic attacks . A group of spawned minions is called a wave . The game's pace fundamentally depends on minion waves.

The thin, long segments represent the minions' regular route along each lane that they march along immediately after spawning. Gameplay - Summoner's Rift [ ] Minion waves [ ] Minions on Summoner's Rift Minions start spawning from each Nexus at 1:05 and keep spawning in waves every 30 seconds for the rest of the match. Each wave comprises several types of minions, which spawn in this order: Super minions If a team's inhibitor is destroyed, one super minion spawns for the enemy team on the same lane as the destroyed inhibitor. If all of a team's inhibitors are destroyed, two super minions spawn on each lane for the enemy team instead. Melee minions Three of them spawn in each wave. Siege minions They do not spawn on waves in which super minions are present. For the first 15 minutes, one spawns every three waves. After the 15 minute mark, one spawns every two waves. After the 25 minute mark, one spawns every wave. Caster minions Three of them spawn in each wave. Behavior [ ] While minions have not acquired a target, they will strictly path linearly along a lane until they find a valid enemy unit. Upon finding one, they will move toward and attack it within their range. Minions respect unit collision as well as player-generated terrain . The first wave 's minions have modified behaviour. Top and bottom lanes' minions are ghosted for 28 seconds, while middle lane minions are ghosted for 18 seconds. They will ignore enemy champions until a champion walks much closer to them or until meeting with the enemy wave. When the waves meet, minions will spread out their attacks on the three enemy melee minions regardless of distance. This special behavior exists so that, in every game, neither side gains a pushing advantage without champion interference since the first wave's melee minions are guaranteed to die at roughly the same time. Nearby enemy minions will become aggressive toward, or " aggro ", an enemy champion within their own variable acquisition range and under certain conditions. When activated by enemy champion actions, this aggression is formally referred to as a Call for Help signal in-game and throughout the wiki, and it is indicated by an icon of three concentrated lines above a minion's health bar (this icon indicates all non-playable units' aggro, including monsters , turrets , pets , etc.). Abilities interacting with / minion Call for Help specifically, is noted under their respective "Details" section within a formatted table ( which includes other fundamental ability properties ). Call for Help signals trigger when: A champion stands in the minion's path, without any other targets within the minions' attack range and outside of a turret 's range. A champion deals damage to an enemy champion with a basic attack, the majority of unit-targeted abilities, and a minority of abilities which are marked as being similar to those two. Minions will prioritize the closest champion in the case there are multiple sources. Bar the first wave (which is noted above as an exception), Call for Help signals are also ignored while minions are already attacking an enemy turret. Priority [ ] When minions find several enemy units, they choose their target using a priority system that follows this order: Enemy champions attacking an allied champion. Enemy minions attacking an allied champion. Enemy minions attacking an allied minion. Enemy turrets attacking an allied minion. Enemy champions attacking an allied minion. The closest enemy minion. The closest enemy champion. Once a minion has chosen a target, it only switches to a new target if that new target has a higher priority. The minion cannot acquire a new target that has the same priority as their current target (and thus continues attacking its current target). Acquisition Range [ ] In general, valid targets must be within 500 units of the minion in order to be acquired. Allied champions being attacked by an enemy champion may be within 1000 range of the minion instead. Timing [ ] Minions reevaluate their target in between each attack windup every few seconds. For instance, if an enemy champion is attacking an allied champion and stops doing so, minions will not stop targeting that champion for a short time afterwards. Vision [ ] When the minion loses sight of its target, the minion switches to a new target or keeps advancing if there are no targets left within sight. Stats mechanics [ ] Minions "upgrade" strictly every 90 seconds (i.e., every third wave), gaining health , attack damage , and possibly certain buffs depending on the game state. Minions deal 50% reduced damage to enemy champions. Minions start with 325 base movement speed and gain 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 (based on minutes) movement speed as the game time progresses. After the first wave and before 14 minutes, all top and bottom lane minions gain bonus movement speed. This increase matches the time it takes for top and bottom lanes' minions and midlane minions to reach the midpoint of each lane, as the side lanes are longer than the middle lane. New spawning minions level up based on their team's average (integer) champion level (e.g. champion levels 15, 10, 18 = minion level 14). Minion levels interact with the minion pushing buff explained below. Buffs [ ] General [ ] Destroying an enemy inhibitor grants a small buff to allied minions in the lane where the inhibitor has been destroyed. Minion Pushing [ ] On Summoner's Rift The team with the higher average champion level gains the minion pushing buff. The buff increases the minion damage against enemy minions and reduces the damage they take from them. Bonus damage = (5% + (5% × Turret advantage of the lane )) × Team level advantage Damage reduction = 1 + ( Turret advantage of the lane × Team level advantage ) Team level advantage is the difference between the (decimal) average of the (integer) levels of the players in one team and the average of the levels of the other. This difference can be a decimal value, and is capped at 3. Turret advantage is the difference between the number of turrets destroyed in one team on a specific lane and the number of turrets destroyed on the other team on that same lane. Note that Nexus turrets are not lane turrets. This difference cannot be below 0. Since there are three turrets on each lane, the maximum possible benefits on Summoner's Rift are: Bonus damage = (5% + (5% × 3)) × 3 = 60% Damage reduction = 1 + (3 × 3) = 10 This buff starts to apply at 3:30. Already-spawned minions will also receive the buff and these values will update for all minions when the level and turret advantages change. On Howling Abyss Minions in the team with higher average champion level receive a buff that reduces damage taken from enemy minions. Damage reduction = Level advantage × Turret advantage Team level advantage is the difference between the (decimal) average of the (integer) levels of the players in one team and the average of the levels of the other. This difference can be a decimal value, and is not capped. Turret advantage is the difference between the number of inner and nexus turrets destroyed for each team. This buff starts to apply at 3:30. Already-spawned minions will also receive the buff and these values will update for all minions when the level and turret advantages change.

Dealing this hit is known as last hitting and is considered one of the most important skills in League of Legends. Every minion is worth 1 CS. In the early- and mid-game, CS along with KDA can be used to measure a player's performance against their lane opponent. Wave Gold Value [ ] In Summoner's Rift , an undistributed wave consists of three melee minions , three caster minions and possibly a siege minion . As of V8.23 , a minion wave has an average gold value that varies from 125 and up to 195 at 25:00. Game time Average gold per wave Calculations Average gold per cs 0:00 125 (3 × 21 ) + (3 × 14 ) + ( 60 ÷ 3) 19.8 15:00 147 (3 × 21 ) + (3 × 14 ) + ( 84 ÷ 2) 22.6 17:15 150 (3 × 21 ) + (3 × 14 ) + ( 90 ÷ 2) 23 25:00 195 (3 × 21 ) + (3 × 14 ) + ( 90 ) 27.6 Wave Strategy [ ] Without player interference, a lane's wave is neither advancing or retreating in any significant amount. A minion wave that catches up with its preceding wave starts pushing the lane towards enemy turret. Big waves of minions can overwhelm a turret. When a player interrupts an enemy minion wave, ensuring their minions deal more damage to the opponent's minions than they are receiving, the lane starts to push . In the simplest way, this is done by killing every minion in a wave without interference from your own minions. This changes where in the lane the minion waves clash. On more sophisticated turning the player makes sure their side is making just slightly more damage thus allowing the wave to build up as the wave gets reinforcements before than the enemy wave. Game Terminology [ ] Some game terms related to minions: Farming : Last hitting minions to earn gold and experience. Lane Momentum : The strength with which the minions in a lane advance without champion aid. Pushing : Attacking enemy minions to keep allied minions alive and allow them to advance along their lane. Freezing : Preventing enemy minions from pushing the lane without pushing them back. "Winions" : A wave of minions so big or so strong that it can destroy turrets , nexuses , or champions without champion aid. Free Farming : Farming without being confronted by an enemy champion. Proxy Farming : Farming behind an enemy tower. It's easier than conventional farming because there is no interference from allied minions, but it's usually much more dangerous. Split Pushing : Attacking several objectives at the same time when at least one of the objectives is a lane turret. Minion Variants [ ] Labels use the Order (blue team) and Chaos (red team) faction names. Summoner's Rift Other Game Modes Evolved Alpha Beta These are all the Minions used after the second Summoner's Rift map update Blue Caster Minion (Order) Red Caster Minion (Chaos) Blue Melee Minion (Order) Red Melee Minion (Chaos) Blue Siege Minion (Order) Red Siege Minion (Chaos) Blue Super Minion (Order) Red Super Minion (Chaos) These are all the Minions used between Beta 1 and Beta 3 Blue Barracks Wizard (Order) Blue Archer Minion (Order) Red Barracks Wizard (Chaos) Red Archer Minion (Chaos) Blue Melee Minion (Order) Red Melee Minion (Chaos) Blue Rider Minion (Order) Red Rider Minion (Chaos) These are all the Minions used between Beta 3 and the second Summoner's Rift map update Blue Caster Minion (Order) Purple Caster Minion (Chaos) Blue Melee Minion (Order) Purple Melee Minion (Chaos) Blue Siege Minion (Order) Unused Blue Siege Minion (Order) Purple Siege Minion (Chaos) Blue Super Minion (Order) Purple Super Minion 1 (Chaos) Purple Super Minion 2 (Chaos) Other game modes refers to April Fools' Day , Arcade , Arcane , PROJECT , Snowdown Showdown and Ultra Rapid Fire Minions.

The team that wins is random. When minions acquire a target, it is possible for a champion to pick up aggro multiple times from a minion. Minions can constantly pick up aggro from you and can follow you through the jungle. By default, each player sees their allied minions and structures in Summoner's Rift in blue and the enemy minions and structures in red. This is just a visual effect, it has no practical effects in the game. Previously, midlane minions had reduced gold bounties, which lasted until 14:00 (until the wave at 13:35). The gold penalty was ultimately removed in V13.12 . Between V10.23 and V12.21 , midlane siege minions were worth 10 less. Compared to other lanes, the total amount of gold from midlane minions was 80 less. Between V12.22 and V13.11 , all midlane minions were worth 1 less (i.e., siege minions were in total worth 1 less instead of 10 less than their regular bounty as before). Compared to other lanes, the total amount of gold from midlane minions was 164 less. Blue Siege Minion in beta is a mobile ballista. The unused Blue Siege Minion model in beta also became the now Blue Siege Minion. Visually, Blue Super Minion 's pilots use two control sticks similar to analog sticks on Siege Minions to control their mech while Red Super Minion 's pilots control their mech with a red crystal sphere, suggesting that magic is used. Patch History [ ] V13.12 Removed: Mid lane minions no longer give 1 less gold before 14:00. V13.10 New Effect: After the first wave and before 14 minutes, side lane minions gain increased movement speed, matching the time it takes for two opposing minion waves to meet at the midpoint of top lane and bottom lane, with the time it takes for the middle lane.
