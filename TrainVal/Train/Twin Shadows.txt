Its active can make it a useful item on mages that lack crowd control. A well timed spell shield can negate the effect of a ghost coming into contact with a champion. It is possible for both ghosts to hit the same champion, but the effect and duration is only refreshed. With this is mind, when chasing or being chased, you can try to soak up both ghosts to eliminate them as a threat. Ghosts may not pass over any blocked terrain, such as Jarvan IV's Cataclysm , you may use this to your advantage to prevent the vision or slow effects for a time.
