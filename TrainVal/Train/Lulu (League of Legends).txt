Each bolt deals 3 − 37 (based on level) (+ 5% AP) magic damage to the first enemy it collides with, for a total of 9 − 111 (based on level) (+ 15% AP) on hitting a single target with all three bolts. Casting Help, Pix! on an ally champion transfers Pix's help to them, causing him to fire the bolts dependent on their basic attacks. Pix snaps back to Lulu if she is too far away. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Default damage Magic Counters Parries Projectile Bypass Blocked Pix's bolts do not fire alongside abilities that apply on-hit effects (e.g. Runaan's Hurricane ).

The empowered attack does not trigger against structures nor wards . Neither of them will intercept Pix's bolts.

Enemy Cast: Lulu launches a spell onto the target enemy champion that polymorphs them into a harmless critter for a duration, during which their base movement speed is reduced by 60 , and disarms them for the same duration. Disable Duration: 1. 2 / 1. 4 / 1. 6 / 1. 8 / 2 Self / Ally Cast: Lulu instantly casts erratic magic upon the target allied champion or herself, granting the target bonus attack speed and 25% (+ 5% per 100 AP) bonus movement speed for the duration. Bonus Attack Speed: 25 / 27. 5 / 30 / 32. 5 / 35% Duration: 3 / 3. 25 / 3. 5 / 3. 75 / 4 Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Minion Aggro Not Drawn Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Whimsy's movement speed reduction is not affected by slow resist . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but still go on cooldown and pay its cost. (bug) This only applies to the enemy cast. Edit Help, Pix! Help, Pix! COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 8 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 650 Active: Lulu can cast Help, Pix! on herself or an ally or enemy. Enemy Cast: Lulu sends Pix to the far side of the target enemy for 4 seconds, dealing magic damage and revealing them for the same duration.

Shield Strength: 75 / 115 / 155 / 195 / 235 (+ 55% AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Not Blocked Help, Pix! can be self-cast . If the player casts Help, Pix! on a non-champion target, the spell script will first search for a targetable allied or enemy champion within 75 radius around the target. If there is at least one, it'll apply the effects to the closest one instead of the initial target. PENDING FOR TEST: Allies or enemies or proximity take priortity? This effect does not respect that the champion may not be visible to Lulu and not a valid target for normal selection for this reason. Therefore it can for instance apply the effects to stealthed enemy champions this way. (bug) Since the original cast did not target the champion, some effects (such as Guardian ) may behave incorrectly. (bug) It is not known in which patch this effect was added. Spell shield and Riposte will block the damage but Pix will still follow regardless. Pix will continue to assist the target ally for the full duration even if the shield breaks (the same applies for the shield if the target ally leaves Pix's leash range). Pix's Glitterlance bolt can be fired while he is away from Lulu from his location and towards the cursor (effectively extending Glitterlance's range).
