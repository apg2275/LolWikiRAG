The first attack restores 20 / 30 / 40 (based on level) energy and the second attack restores 「 10 / 15 / 20 (based on level) energy . 」 「 half of the previous amount. 」 Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Counters Parries See Notes Flurry will still restore energy even if the attacks are blocked or missed while Lee Sin is blinded , but not dodged . Edit Sonic Wave Sonic Wave COST: 50 Energy COOLDOWN : 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1200 EFFECT RADIUS: 400 WIDTH: 120 SPEED: 1800 Active: Lee Sin fires a sonic blast in the target direction that deals physical damage to the first enemy hit and marks them for 3 seconds, during which they are revealed . Physical Damage: 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 (+ 115% bonus AD) While the target is marked, Lee Sin can cast Resonating Strike . Edit Resonating Strike Resonating Strike COST: 25 Energy CAST TIME: none RANGE: 1250 SPEED: 1350 + 100% movement speed Active: Lee Sin dashes to the nearby enemy marked by Sonic Wave . Upon arrival, he consumes the mark and deals physical damage , increased by 0% − 100% (based on target's missing health) . Minimum Physical Damage: 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 (+ 115% bonus AD) Maximum Physical Damage: 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 / 310 (+ 230% bonus AD) Iron Will and Cripple can be cast during the dash. Hide Sonic Wave Details Resonating Strike Details Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Notes This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Notes Lee Sin will track the target if they change locations. He will dash to the target's previous location without consuming the mark if the target is too far away or moves beyond 2000 units. Lee Sin will attempt to place himself on top of the target upon arrival. The damage dealt by Resonating Strike can be negated if the target blinks . Sometimes, Lee Sin will end the dash at their last location but appear on top of the target after a short delay. Originally, Lee Sin would land 50 units in front of his target. Since there are no patch notes where this is noted to have changed, landing on top of his target may be a bug. Resonating Strike cannot be cast without the marked target nearby or if the target is untargetable . If Resonating Strike interrupts another dash, Tempest and Dragon's Rage can be cast during it (both otherwise cannot be cast). Attacking Disabled Abilities Safeguard , Iron Will , and Cripple can be cast. Tempest and Dragon's Rage are disabled. Movement Disabled Items Usable All the other item-actives are usable Disabled Interrupted by Hextech Rocketbelt Stridebreaker Consumables Usable Spells Usable Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Teleport Disabled Recall Interrupted by Flash Interrupted by Death Edit Safeguard Safeguard COST: 50 Energy COOLDOWN : 12 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 700 SPEED: 1350 + 100% movement speed Active: Lee Sin dashes to the target allied unit's location. If the ally is a champion upon arrival, both they and Lee Sin gain a shield for 2 seconds and Safeguard's cooldown is halved. Lee Sin can self-cast Safeguard to shield himself. Shield Strength: 50 / 100 / 150 / 200 / 250 (+ 80% AP) After Safeguard is cast, Lee Sin can cast Iron Will within the next 3 seconds. Iron Will and Cripple can be cast during the dash. Edit Iron Will Iron Will COST: 25 Energy CAST TIME: none Active: Lee Sin gains life steal and spell vamp for 4 seconds. Bonus Drain: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26% Hide Safeguard Details Iron Will Details Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted Notes Lee Sin cannot self-cast Safeguard even while grounded or rooted . Safeguard can be used on any targetable allied unit excluding structures . This includes champions , minions , wards , and champion summoned units (e.g. Noxious Trap , Demacian Standard , Dark Passage ). If no unit is directly targeted, Safeguard will search for wards in a 100 radius to target. This aids Lee Sin in performing the dash to a ward he just placed. Safeguard will not grant its shield if the dash is interrupted. If the dash overrides or is overridden by Resonating Strike , he will grant the shield immediately rather than on arrival. If Safeguard's dash interrupts another dash, Tempest and Dragon's Rage can be cast during it (both otherwise cannot be cast). Targeting input Auto Notes No additional details. Edit Tempest Tempest COST: 50 Energy COOLDOWN : 9 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 450 Active: Lee Sin smashes the ground beneath him, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies, marking them for 4 seconds and, if they are not invisible when struck, revealing them for the same duration. Magic Damage: 35 / 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 (+ 100% AD) If Tempest hits an enemy, Lee Sin can cast Cripple within the next 3 seconds after a 0. 1 -second delay. Edit Cripple Cripple COST: 25 energy CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 550 / 600 SPEED: 1600 Active: Lee Sin sends a wave to nearby enemies marked by Tempest , which slows them for 4 seconds, decaying over the duration. Slow: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80% Hide Tempest Details Cripple Details Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Notes Tempest's sight reveal only reveals the affected targets, but visually also lights up the Fog of War in a 400 radius. Tempest's sight reveal is not removed when Lee Sin casts Cripple (unlike Sonic Wave's ). This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Targeting input Auto Counters Spell shield Blocked Notes Tempest's reveal is not removed when Lee Sin casts Cripple . Cripple cannot be cast without a marked target within 550 range. The missiles Lee Sin sends out are nowadays missing their visual effects. (bug) Edit Dragon's Rage Dragon's Rage COOLDOWN: 110 / 85 / 60 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 375 COLLISION RADIUS: 160 Active: Lee Sin roots the target enemy champion over the cast time, then roundhouse kicks them to deal physical damage and knock them back up to 800 units over 0. 8 seconds , rendering them airborne for 1 second. Physical Damage: 175 / 400 / 625 (+ 200% bonus AD) Enemies that collide with the displaced enemy while it is airborne take the same damage plus bonus physical damage and are knocked up for 1 second. Collision Physical Damage: 175 / 400 / 625 (+ 200% bonus AD) (+ 12 / 15 / 18% of primary target's bonus health) Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro See Notes Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Blocked Applies spell damage to the primary target and area damage to secondary targets. The spell indicator for this ability also displays the direction for the knock back relative to Lee Sin's position. If the target of Dragon Rage dies initially on the first hit there will be no displacement of any kind. The displacement's direction is decided at the moment of impact and not by Lee Sin and his target's relative locations at the start of the cast (the only way for Lee Sin to control where his target is displaced is by using Flash before the cast time of Dragon's Rage ends). If the airborne debuff is removed from the target, its ability to collide with enemies is removed aswell, even if the target has not come to a stop yet. (bug) The airborne debuff and with it collision of the target remains for the normal duration even if its trajectory is displaced by another source (i.e - Headbutt ). The target may still collide with other enemies for the remaining airborne duration after they reach their destination, as the airborne debuff lasts longer than the displacement. The knockback distance is intended to be 800, but due to a bug, this is reduced by up-to the sum of Lee Sin's and his target's gameplay radius , depending on how far they are away from one another at the end of the cast time. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Lee Sin was one of the first six champions designed (the others being Annie , Singed , Sion , Sivir , and Twisted Fate ) [2] [3] Lee Sin is the only allegedly canceled champion reintroduced with his original name. Lee Sin is the first champion to be redesigned and to be technically given a relaunch skin ( Traditional Lee Sin ), although it was done prior to his actual release. Lee Sin is the first champion to feature two ' Champion Spotlights ' (an April Fools' Day one and a real one). Lee Sin is the second of eight champions to have more than four abilities (the others being Elise , Gnar , Heimerdinger , Jayce , Karma , Nidalee , and Rek'Sai ). Lee Sin is the first monk type champion announced but the second to be released (after Udyr ). Lee Sin is the first non-ninja Ionian champion to use energy . Lee Sin's dance references Shaolin Soccer . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. An inside joke is that Lee Sin was taught Dragon's Rage by Jesse Perring (yet the Blind Monk does not kick players off the map).
