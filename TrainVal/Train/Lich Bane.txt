Similar items Essence Reaver Iceborn Gauntlet Nashor's Tooth Trinity Force Stormsurge Cosmic Drive Mejai's Soulstealer Notes The movement speed stat only increases flat movement speed, and will not interact with other percentage increases. Spellblade deals proc damage , and thus will not trigger spell effects . Spellblade is not blocked by spell shield if applied by a basic attack. It is blocked if the effect is applied by an ability that triggers on-hit effects. Spellblade can be blocked (negates the damage, consumes the effect, and places it on cooldown) and dodged (prevents the effect from triggering altogether). Block will prevent Essence Reaver's mana restore. Spellblade is not affected by critical strike modifiers. Spellblade's bonus damage benefits from life steal , omnivamp , and physical vamp (this one excludes Lich Bane ) but not spell vamp . Spellblade's cooldown starts after the enhanced attack is consumed and consecutive ability casts refresh the duration of the enhanced attack. Spellblade will trigger against structures . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Ability haste changed to 20. Movement speed changed to 10%. Spellblade AP ratio changed to 66% AP . Strategy In comparison to other Spellblade items, Lich Bane is a more appropriate choice for magic damage dealers that also use basic attacks. Champions that are hybrid, both physical and magic damage focused, may prefer Lich Bane over Trinity Force as it scales much better due to also having a scaling with ability power. Lich Bane's scaling with ability power separates it from Trinity Force as it does not necessarily need to be utilized by champions with high base attack damage to deal the most bonus damage. This does not mean champions with that luxury should not build it, as it does also scale with base attack damage.
