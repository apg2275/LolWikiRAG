Spirit Rush uses quick cast by default. There's a slight delay before a champion gains vision of the fog of war once inside it. Because of this, if Ahri dashes into it, it is possible that Spirit Rush will not target any enemy in range. The bolts do not fire if Ahri dies while dashing , unless she was saved by resurrection . The bolts will fire if the dash is interrupted by other means.

The first icon for Spirit Rush's displays Ahri without fox ears, which harkens to the time she didn't have them. Some of her older models, such as Original Ahri and Midnight Ahri , lack whiskers ingame. Ahri 아리 could've been shortened from '아리땁다' Arittabda , from stative verbal stem aritta(b)- "be beautiful" & verbal suffix -da. For "The most visually appealing champion in League", Ahri's visual appeal is statistically ranked 1st among men, and 2nd among women (second to Jinx ). [2] Ahri's Series 1 Eternals make the following references: LDR refernces the eponymous acronym that stands for "long-distance relationship" and the large distance covered from Spirit Rush's multiple dashes. On the Rebound references the eponymous phrase associated with unhappy relationships and the literal rebound of Orb of Deception's projectile.
