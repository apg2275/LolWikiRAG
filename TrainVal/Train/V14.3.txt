[1] , Riot's signature anti-cheat. Upon first launch of the League Client starting this patch, a diagnostic tool will run in the background in order to check if the system is compatible with Vanguard and ready for the update. If the check fails, it will run again automatically on later launches. This diagnostic can be manually executed through the Settings -> General -> Check for Compatibility . The software will not be required until a later date in the near future [ Retroactive editorial note : The launch of Vanguard was originally planned for patch 14.4, but in the next patch Riot announce that it will release in 14.5]. Behavioral Systems After reporting a player for Verbal Abuse and/or Hate Speech, you will receive a pop-up at the end of the game where you can easily block the player or change your chat settings. To prevent this pop up from showing each time, you can use the "Do not show this again" toggle. If you want to re-enable the modal later you can do so in Settings > Chat & Friends.
