When the Blood Well is filled, Aatrox becomes Hellbent for 4 seconds as the Blood Well drains. While Hellbent , dealing or taking damage against enemy champions or neutral monsters will completely fill the Blood Well and refresh Hellbent's duration. Hellbent: Aatrox gains 25% increased base AD and 30 / 40 / 50 / 60% (based on level) bonus attack speed . Upon taking fatal damage Aatrox will revive over 3 seconds, recovering 30% of maximum health over the duration. Upon reviving, Aatrox instantly recovers 100% of Blood Well . Aatrox's revive is then put on a cooldown. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Aatrox's resource bar colors red when Hellbent is active (light red when the revive is off cooldown, dark red when on cooldown) Chronoshift and Guardian Angel's passive will take precedence over Blood Well's revive. Blood Well's stasis causes Aatrox to become untargetable , which will reset turret aggro. Tethers from abilities ( Soul Shackles ) will remain active while Aatrox is reviving. Blood Well's healing component interacts with Spirit Visage's passive. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Aatrox_IVideo_old.ogv Dark Flight Dark Flight COOLDOWN: 13 / 12. 5 / 12 / 11. 5 / 11 TARGET RANGE: 650 EFFECT RADIUS: 225 INNER RADIUS: 75 Active: After a brief delay, Aatrox dashes to the target area unstoppably , filling 20% of his Blood Well , dealing physical damage to nearby units upon landing, and knocking up all units in the epicenter for 1 second. Physical Damage: 20 / 50 / 80 / 110 / 140 (+ 110% AD) Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Ground Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Not Interrupted Dark Flight possesses a considerable overhead for a dash ability, able to traverse many walls that are otherwise much wider than the indicator suggests is possible to vault. If Aatrox is sent airborne or forced into Blood Well's stasis during the initial flight time, Dark Flight will fail and will not cause him to dash. Other forms of crowd control applied while the animation is in progress will be suspended until the animation finishes. Dark Flight does not cancel other commands. Aatrox will immediately begin attacking after he lands. With smartcast on, Dark Flight will be cast immediately and at 650 -range if the cursor is beyond that. Flash cannot be cast during Dark Flight . Dark Flight has a 0. 6 second cast time. 0. 3 second wind-up, and 0. 3 second wind-down. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Aatrox_QVideo_old.ogv Blood Thirst / Blood Price Blood Thirst / Blood Price STATIC COOLDOWN: 0. 5 Passive: Aatrox applies a bonus on-hit effect on every third hit against non-structures. Toggle Off – Blood Thirst : Aatrox heals himself on-hit. Heal: 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 (+ 6. 5 % missing health) Toggle On – Blood Price : Aatrox deals bonus on-hit physical damage and fills 20% of his Blood Well . Physical Damage: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 75% bonus AD) Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Unit / Self Damage type Sub-type Physical Counters Spell shield Not Blocked The attack counter between Blood Thirst and Blood Price is shared, meaning that toggling the ability with one empowered attack prepared will immediately allow use of the empowered attack of the other. Toggling between Blood Thirst and Blood Price does not reset the basic attack timer. It will, however, cancel an empowered basic attack in its windup animation if it is toggled during that time. Toggled abilities do not count as ability activation for the purposes of effects such as Spellblade or Force Pulse . Aatrox's basic attack animation correlates with the amount of stacks for Blood Thirst/Price . The first basic attack animation (after leveling up Blood Thirst/Price or proccing an empowered basic attack) is Aatrox swinging his sword to the left, the second is to the right and the third basic attack animation (which will be affected by Blood Thirst/Price ) is Aatrox stabbing the target. Blood Thirst/Price will not proc against turrets or wards. The triggering attack will apply other on-hit effects and can critically strike as normal. Unlike most other on-hit physical damage, Blood Price's bonus damage does not apply life steal ; this is a special case. The triggering attack will still apply life steal. However, using Death's Dance would then heal Aatrox for 15% of the Blood Price's bonus damage. Blood Thirst/Price will miss if Aatrox is blinded . Critical strikes do not interact with the bonus damage of Blood Thirst/Blood Price. If Blood Thirst/Price is blocked or parried , the effect will still apply, but the base damage will not. If Blood Thirst/Price is dodged , the effect and base damage will apply as normal.

Physical Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 70% bonus AD) Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Units may only be damaged by one projectile of Blades of Torment per cast. The ability fires two narrow skillshots, converging at a fixed range. Very small units ( such as minions ) can potentially avoid the damage and slow altogether if the blades are fired from a close enough range.

Has a width of 150 decreasing as it converges on its max range.
