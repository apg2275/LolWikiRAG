The third stack consumes them all to deal 15 / 30 / 45 / 60% (based on level) AD bonus physical damage and heal Xin Zhao for 3 / 3. 5 / 4% (based on level) of his maximum health (+ 65% AP) . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Physical Counters Parries Missing The stack counter displays 1–3 rather than the usual 0–2, meaning that a count of 1 does not translate to having 1 stack. Wind Becomes Lightning's generates one stack per strike that hits at least one enemy. Stacks reset when Xin Zhao dies . Stacks of Determination will be gained even if the attack is blocked . PENDING FOR TEST: : Determination's interaction with parrying effects ( dodge , blind ). Determination deals proc damage . Since it is a separate instance of damage when applied by basic attack or either of Wind Becomes Lightning's strikes, flat damage reduction that applies to both the main and bonus damage such as Amumu's Tantrum's passive will reduce each, for twice the reduction. The bonus damage cannot critically strike . When applied by a basic attack: The attack uses a unique animation. The bonus damage benefits from life steal . PENDING FOR TEST: It applies life steal specifically. When applied by either of Wind Becomes Lightning's strikes: Triggers against the closest target struck by the strike (equals first target to receive spell effects). Does not benefit from life steal , including not healing from Wind Becomes Lightning's 33% conversion for this bonus damage. Since proc damage is 'single target', Vamp will heal from 100% of the bonus damage. Edit Three Talon Strike Three Talon Strike COST: 30 Mana COOLDOWN : 7 / 6. 5 / 6 / 5. 5 / 5 CAST TIME: none Active: Xin Zhao empowers his next three basic attacks on-attack to each have an uncancellable windup , deal bonus physical damage and reduce his other abilities' current cooldowns by 1 second. Each attack refreshes the duration. Bonus Physical Damage: 16 / 25 / 34 / 43 / 52 (+ 40% bonus AD) Total Bonus Physical Damage: 48 / 75 / 102 / 129 / 156 (+ 120% bonus AD) The third attack knocks up the target for 0. 75 seconds. Three Talon Strike's bonus damage is affected by critical strike modifiers. Three Talon Strike resets Xin Zhao's basic attack timer. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Basic damage Physical Counters Spell shield Parries See Notes Blocked Spell shield will only block the third attack. The enhanced attacks present input buffering during their wind-up animation ( Xin Zhao cannot be issued any commands until after it ends). Edit Wind Becomes Lightning Wind Becomes Lightning COST: 60 / 55 / 50 / 45 / 40 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 5 RANGE: 1000 / 940 EFFECT RADIUS: 275 / 125 WIDTH: 80 ANGLE: 160º SPEED: 6250 Active: Xin Zhao slashes in an arc and, after the cast time, thrusts his spear in a line in the target direction. Each strike deals physical damage to enemies hit, modified to 50% − 100% (based on level) against minions . The thrust deals increased damage, further by 0% − 33. 3 % (based on critical strike chance) , and slows enemies hit by 50% for 1. 5 seconds. Enemy champions and monsters hit are also marked Challenged for 3 seconds, during which they are revealed . Slash Physical Damage: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 (+ 30% AD) Thrust Physical Damage: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 90% AD) (+ 65% AP) Total Physical Damage: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 120% AD) (+ 65% AP) The durations of Three Talon Strike , Audacious Charge's bonus attack speed , and Crescent Guard are delayed relative to Wind Becomes Lightning's cast time after 0. 2 seconds of its activation. Wind Becomes Lightning's damage heals Xin Zhao for 33. 3 % of his life steal . Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Not Blocked Spell shield will block only a single instance of damage - either the thrust or the slash. The first strike will occur immediately and the second will occur after the cast time completes. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. The first strike will occur from wherever Xin Zhao is at the start of the cast time. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. The second strike will occur from wherever Xin Zhao is at the end of the cast time. The first strike's hitbox includes a 275 radius 160° cone in front of Xin Zhao and an additional 125 radius around him. The second strike's hitbox includes the same 125 radius around Xin Zhao , a missile with 1000 range and 80 total width, and a -60 radius area check upon the end of the missile. The 125 radius check does not hit champion summoned units . (bug) Because Wind Becomes Lightning uses an older type of 'healing based on life steal' and not applies life steal , Spirit Visage will amplify the life gain twice (+25% life steal and +25% healing), for a total of +56. 25 %. Edit Audacious Charge Audacious Charge COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 11 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 650 / 1100 EFFECT RADIUS: 250 SPEED: 2500 Active: Xin Zhao dashes to the target enemy's location, dealing magic damage to enemies near them and slowing them by 30% for 0. 5 seconds. Audacious Charge's range is increased against Challenged targets. Magic Damage: 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 (+ 60% AP) Xin Zhao then gains bonus attack speed for 5 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% Three Talon Strike and Crescent Guard can be cast during the dash. Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit / Location Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Area damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted The primary target cannot dodge Audacious Charge's effects. The target will always emit the area of effect from their position. If no unit is targeted directly, Audacious Charge will search for possible targets in a 200 radius around the target location. Edit Crescent Guard Crescent Guard COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 110 / 100 CAST TIME: 0. 35 EFFECT RADIUS: 500 / 450 Passive - Challenge: The last enemy champion hit by Xin Zhao's basic attacks or Audacious Charge is marked Challenged for 3 seconds. Active: Xin Zhao sweeps his spear around him, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies, capped at 600 against monsters , and knocking back all non- Challenged targets hit up-to 700 units over 0. 75 seconds, as well as stunning them for the same duration. Physical Damage: 75 / 175 / 275 (+ 100% bonus AD) (+ 110% AP) (+ 15% of target's current health) For the next 4 seconds, Xin Zhao is invulnerable against enemy champions far away from him. Hide Details Tips & Tricks Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Pets , traps , ground AoEs , DoTs , and delayed-damage abilities (e.g. Death Mark , Explosive Charge , Hemoplague ) will not damage Xin Zhao if the enemy champion source is outside the circle when the damage applies. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun . Tips & Tricks Enemies will not be marked as Challenged if Crescent Guard has not been learned. Learning the ability after an enemy would have been marked will still cause them to be knocked back .

Original View in 3D 585 13.07.2010 Xin Zhao is a resolute warrior loyal to the ruling Lightshield dynasty. Once condemned to the fighting pits of Noxus, he survived countless gladiatorial bouts, but after being freed by Demacian forces, he swore his life and allegiance to these brave liberators. Armed with his favored three-talon spear, Xin Zhao now fights for his adopted kingdom, audaciously challenging any foe, no matter the odds.

He just chooses not to, because it gets fruit chunks all over his spear.

Of course, his progenitors didn't ride an army of armored black pegasi into battle, but you know how it is. Richard Epcar Robin Ruan Wonders of the World Loot eligible Legacy Warring Kingdoms View in 3D 1350 08.02.2013 Legendary warrior and proud general both, Xin Zhao fights across the Warring Kingdoms to preserve peace for the common man. His spear is said to be sharp enough to pierce the sky, striking with the force of thunder.

This is probably for the best as most encounters he's involved in tend to include close encounters of the third kind, protecting civilians against terrifying extraterrestrial invaders, or evading aggressive UFO dive bombers.

Xin Zhao is the steadfast protector of these cosmic cradles, driving off any that would devour them.

These commanders seek only to reclaim the might with which their order once ruled. Xin Zhao is one half of the pair of current leaders. Pragmatic and measured, he has resurrected an ancient Magelord to destroy his foes once and for all.

He is the reliable protector that keeps his more chaotic friends from getting into often-explosive mischief, and does it all with a cool, casual grace that leaves everyone swooning.

Xin Zhao was released when Season One started. Xin Zhao's dance references Seung Mi-na's dance from Soulcalibur II . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . During development, he was called XenZiou or XenZhao . Xin Zhao is rendered, in Chinese localization, as 赵信 Zhào Xìn [ʈ͡ʂau̯˥˩ ɕin˥˩], coincidentally the name of a Xiongnu general who temporarily defected to Han Chinese forces, though historical inspiration for Xin Zhao is evidently another Chinese general, Zhao Yun . 信 xìn means "to believe, to trust" < Old Chinese *sins < *winʔ (cf. Sino-Tibetan root *yum [2] > 允 yǔn [ɥyn˨˩˦] "to be proper, to consent" [3] ). As a gladiator, Xin Zhao took the name of the fishing boat Viscero < Latin viscus "entrails", where he once worked on.
