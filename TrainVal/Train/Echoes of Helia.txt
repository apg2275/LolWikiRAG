Similar items Imperial Mandate Moonstone Renewer Shurelya's Battlesong Ardent Censer Staff of Flowing Water Dawncore Notes Soul Siphon deals default damage , and thus will not trigger spell effects . Soul Siphon's damage is not blocked by spell shield . The shard missile is however blocked. (bug) Soul Siphon is an auto-targeted effect. The healing missile has a global range. Triggering Soul Siphon launches a projectile to each of the affected units, despite the effect being instant. The healing missile and damaging missile land after 0. 32 seconds and 0. 4 seconds, respectively. Soul Siphon will not trigger if the ally is at full health and there are no nearby enemies. Soul Siphon affects untargetable allies. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Ability haste changed to 40. Health changed to 400.
