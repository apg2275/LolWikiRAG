In the 2009 Official Teaser Trailer for League of Legends as well as in one of the concept art for her, Sivir had pink hair. In the Founding Interns of League of Legends YouTube video uploaded by the Riot Games Channel , concept art for Sivir was shown to depict her with blonde hair and an overall wildly different design. The moments she appears in the video are here and here . Sivir is the second to feature two ' Champion Spotlights ' due to significant gameplay changes (the others being Ezreal , Karma , Katarina , and Lee Sin ). Sivir was one of the first six champions designed, together with Annie , Lee Sin , Singed , Sion , and Twisted Fate . [2] [3] Sivir resembles Latin adjective severus "grim, stern, strict". Sivir, the Battle Mistress Sivir's Chalicar's name and design were inspired by the Indian chakram . Her dance references the Arm Wave dance . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Sivir was going to have an e-sports skin to celebrate SK Telecom T1 winning the Season 5 World Championship. SKT T1 Bang (the one she represented) requested she be swapped for SKT T1 Kalista after the whole set was pulled from PBE back in V6.8 to be updated.
