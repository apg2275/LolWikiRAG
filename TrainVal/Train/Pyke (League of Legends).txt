Innate: Pyke stores 9% (+ 0. 2 % per 1 Lethality) of the post-mitigation damage he takes from enemy champions as grey health on his health bar , increased to 40% (+ 0. 4 % per 1 Lethality) while there are two or more visible enemy champions nearby. He can store up to 80 (+ 800% bonus AD) grey health , with an upper cap of 55% of his maximum health . While Pyke is not visible to enemies, he rapidly consumes his grey health to heal for the same amount. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Game elements that increase health based on the champion's health (e.g Overgrowth ) will increase the health before getting converted by Gift of the Drowned Ones , thus granting increased bonus AD . Spirit Visage and Grievous Wounds take effect after Gift of the Drowned Ones's healing cap. Pyke's grey health does not have a time limit, and will stay on his health bar until Pyke leaves enemy vision or dies. Since Pyke's maximum health cannot be increased, Gift of the Drowned Ones reaches the upper cap of 55% of maximum health at 40. 25 − 180. 5 (based on level) bonus attack damage . Untargetable champions count towards Pyke's modified grey health storing.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Pyke is one of 20 champions without a single ability power ratio on any ability: Aatrox , Camille , Darius , Dr. Mundo , Draven , Garen , Kayn , Kled , Naafiri , Nilah , Olaf , Riven , Samira , Sett , Talon , Urgot , Xayah , Yone , and Zed . Pyke's name is a pun on the pole weapon and the predatory fish , both from PIE root *(s)pey- "sharp, pointy stick". [2] Namely, Pyke , the capital of the Iron Islands, an island state within the continent of Westeros; Pyke's inhabitants also worship a deity called "the Drowned God". Pyke will play his critical strike animation when applying Duskblade of Draktharr's bonus damage, additionally using the Toggle key bind (default [Ctrl] + [5]) will also display his critical strike animation on his next attack. Bone Skewer can be toggled to stop glowing with the Toggle key bind (default [Ctrl] + [5]). It will revert to glowing at 1:00 or whenever he respawns. Pyke's dance references the traditional Māori Haka warrior dance. A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . He shares this dance with Rengar . Bone Skewer's shape is possibly based on those of harpoon -heads carved from bone , antler , & walrus ivory , [3] [4] though his is made of metal and magnified to be effective against gigantic in-universe sea-monsters. Pyke is one of the two champions in the game whose health can not be improved except through growth per level, the other being Kled . Pyke quite coincidentally shares his name with a location in George R.R. Martin's novel series A Song of Ice and Fire . Gift of the Drowned Ones grants 1 bonus movement speed to Pyke while in river . Gift of the Drowned Ones is 93.75% gold efficient . 1 HP = 2.66... gold. (calculated with Ruby Crystal . 400g / 150 hp = 2.66) 1 AD = 35 gold. (calculate with Long Sword . 350g / 10ad = 35g) AD/HP (35 / 2.66) = 13.125 (this is to find where AD=HP, meaning 13.125 HP is equal to 1 AD. The equation would be 13.75[HP] = [AD]) Pyke's passive converts every 14 bonus hp into 1 ad. so if you divide 13.125 by 14, you get 0.9375, meaning each bonus HP you buy is only 93.75% the gold value you get for each AD. 100% efficiency would be 8 AD for every 105 HP.
