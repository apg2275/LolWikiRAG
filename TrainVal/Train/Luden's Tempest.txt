Echo deals default damage , and thus will not trigger spell effects . Echo is blocked by spell shield . Echo is an auto-targeted effect. Echo's bolts are projectiles . Echo's cooldown reduction mechanic functions on a charge based system wherein each ability cast or refreshing of the cooldown grants up to 6 charges. Each of these charges are used to reduce the cooldown and can be spent by any instance of ability damage, even if said instances or charges come from a different source. If an ability is cast and has more than 6 ticks of damage, it will only be able to consume a charge for up to 6 of its damage instances due to Echo only granting 6 charges. However, since the charges are refreshed with every ability cast, the user can cast another ability to grant themselves even more charges to allow the initial ability they casted to consume more than 6 charges.
