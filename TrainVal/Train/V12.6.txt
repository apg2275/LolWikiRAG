Clash Freljord Clash: Team formation for the second weekend of the Freljord Cup starts on March 28, and the tournaments will be on April 2 and 3. Hextech Rentals We're removing the ability to activate loot shards to rent champions, skins, and ward skins for 7 days. Virtually no one used the rental system; many players didn't even know it existed. Any rentals that are currently active will still stay active for their remaining duration. The ability to upgrade shards into permanents, reroll them into permanents, or disenchant them into essence is not affected by any of these changes. Mythic Content Overhaul [ ] Mythic Content Overhaul Mythic Essence Gemstones and Prestige Points are combining into a single new currency that never expires: Mythic Essence. Mythic Essence (ME) can be obtained everywhere Gemstones or Prestige Points were previously earned. You can spend Mythic Essence in the Mythic Shop for special skins, accessories, and more. All players will receive a one-time mission on March 31, 2022 that rewards 10 Mythic Essence to celebrate the launch of the new system. This mission will expire on May 2, 2022. All Gemstones in player inventories have automatically been converted to 10 Mythic Essence each. Prestige Points (2020) have expired and were removed from inventories on March 24, 2022. Mythic Essence drop rates from Masterwork Chests have been increased to offset the removal of Prestige Points from chest bundles. Mythic Shop The new Mythic Shop features content that rotates on a regular basis, including the return of past Prestige skins. Mythic skins and accessories in the Mythic Shop will rotate every three months (every 6 patches). New Mythic skins debut at 100 ME and will cost 125 ME in future unvaults. Legacy Mythic skins that were once purchasable via Gemstones (such as Hextech Annie or Soulstealer Vayne ) will also be available in the shop and cost 100 ME on first unvault, and 125 ME on future ones. Mythic skins and accessories (Patch 12.6 - 12.12 rotation): Ashen Knight Pyke (100 ME) Ashen Knight Pyke Emberwoken Chroma + Ashen Knight Pyke summoner icon (40 ME) I'm Comin' For Ya Emote emote (25 ME) Hextech Annie (100 ME) Hextech Amumu (100 ME) Mythic accessories and other options (available year-round): Ashen ward (50 ME) Random skin shard (10 ME) 50 (1 ME) 150 (1 ME) We've added the Random Skin Shard option and removed the Hextech Chest and Hextech Key options since our original announcement. Unvaulted Prestige Skins Prestige skins can only appear in the Mythic Shop at least one year after their original release. They'll cost 125 ME the first time they're offered in the Mythic Shop, 150 ME on the second, and 200 ME if they've been unvaulted three or more times. Prestige skins from 2018 and 2019 start at higher tiers to respect original owners who obtained them when they were more exclusive before the overhaul. Usually two Prestige skins will be unvaulted at a time and will be available in the Mythic Shop for one month (2 patches). However, to celebrate the new shop's launch, we're unvaulting six Prestige skins that will be available for three months (6 patches). Unvaulted Prestige skins (Patch 12.6 - 12.12 rotation): Prestige Arcanist Zoe (125 ME) Prestige Spirit Blossom Teemo (125 ME) Prestige Battle Queen Diana (125 ME) Prestige PROJECT: Irelia (150 ME) Prestige Pulsefire Thresh (150 ME) Prestige K/DA Kai'Sa (200 ME) Commemorative Prestige Skins To recognize the higher investment required to obtain Prestige skins in 2018 and 2019, players who owned these skins before patch 12.5 will receive additional, exclusive 2022 editions of these skins. Commemorative Prestige skins will never be available via shops, loot, or rerolls. The following skins will be gradually distributed to original owners over the next month: Prestige Blood Moon Aatrox (2022) Prestige K/DA Ahri (2022) Prestige K/DA Akali (2022) Prestige Arcade Caitlyn (2022) Prestige K/DA Evelynn 2022) Prestige Fuzz Fizz (2022) Prestige K/DA Kai'Sa (2022) Prestige Nightbringer Lee Sin (2022) Prestige Battle Academia Lux (2022) Prestige Bewitching Miss Fortune (2022) Prestige Star Guardian Neeko (2022) Prestige Firecracker Vayne (2022) Prestige PROJECT: Irelia (2022) Prestige Valiant Sword Riven (2022) Prestige Pulsefire Thresh (2022) Prestige True Damage Qiyana (2022) Exclusive Mythic and Prestige Skin Debuts To highlight the release of new Mythic and Prestige skins, limited edition loading screen borders and summoner icons can now only be obtained by purchasing the skin in the Mythic Shop or event Token Shop during the skin's initial debut period. Once a Mythic or Prestige skin is no longer available in these shops, it will be added to the regular loot drop and skin shard reroll pools without the limited edition loading screen border and summoner icon. This means that Mythic and Prestige skins can still be obtained via loot drops or skin rerolls but only after their debut period ends, and without their matching borders and icons. Note: This is another change from our original plan of removing Mythic and Prestige skins from loot drops and rerolls permanently, based on player feedback. This option grants players exclusive content for unlocking skins during debut periods and also allows collectors to obtain these skins via loot and rerolls without needing to wait for them to unvault. Phase 2 Update All of the above announcements are just Phase 1 of the Mythic Content Overhaul! While we're not launching Phase 2 just yet, we do have one big update to share regarding Showcase and Masterwork Milestones, which are reward tracks that will replace much of what was offered through Prestige Points in the past. We've adjusted our plans for Showcase Milestones, and Prestige skins that debut during Showcases will be available for purchase in the Mythic Shop for 125 ME rather than as the final reward of a Showcase Milestone track. Once the Showcase ends, the Prestige skin will immediately retire from the Mythic Shop and become available via loot drops and rerolls without its border and icon, just like other vaulted Prestige skins. We'll be adjusting the Showcase milestone rewards track to accommodate this update. There's also a Phase 3 of the Mythic Content Overhaul, more details coming later this year.
