Lux's basic attacks and Final Spark consume the mark to deal 30 − 200 (based on level) (+ 25% AP) bonus magic damage . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries See Notes Missing Starting an attack windup against a target with a mark that is about to expire refreshes its duration to 0. 25 seconds. Casting Final Spark refreshes the marks of all marked enemies to 1. 25 seconds if they are within 5000 units of the ability's casting position and have a mark with a remaining duration of less than 1 second. Spell shield prevents Final Spark from consuming the mark. The on-hit damage from Illumination via basic attack cannot be blocked by spell shield . Illumination's trigger from a basic attack can be blocked (bonus damage is negated and the mark will still be consumed). PENDING FOR TEST: : Parry interactions ( dodge , blind ). Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit AP ratio changed to 45% AP . Edit Light Binding Light Binding COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 11 / 10. 5 / 10 / 9. 5 / 9 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 1300 / 1240 WIDTH: 140 SPEED: 1200 Active: Lux shoots a sphere of light in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first two enemies hit and roots them for 2 seconds. Magic Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 60% AP) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Targets immune to the root still count towards Light Binding's two-target limit. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Light Binding spawns an additional missile at the same location and vector as the main missile. This additional "Dummy" missile has the same visual effects as the main missile and gets destroyed when it hits a single enemy, thereby making the surviving VFX of the single missile weaker in intensity. PENDING FOR TEST: This hacky solution also causes Lux Q to count as two skillshots for things such as "skillshots dodged" Eternals. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 / 270. AP ratio changed to 65% AP . Cooldown changed to 10 / 9. 5 / 9 / 8. 5 / 8 seconds. Edit Prismatic Barrier Prismatic Barrier COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: * 1175 EFFECT RADIUS: 110 WIDTH: 220 SPEED: 2400 Active: Lux throws her wand in the target direction that homes back to her after reaching maximum range. Allied champions hit by the wand gain a shield for 2. 5 seconds, which can stack up to 2 times, stacking with the previous shield and refreshing its duration. Shield Strength: 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 (+ 40% AP) Maximum Shield: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 80% AP) Lux receives the shield upon throwing the wand and upon its return. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Counters Projectile See Notes Each pass of the wand grants a shield to each target once. Prismatic Barrier may only stack up to 2 times. Subsequent instances of passing through the wand have no effect on the shield's strength nor duration. The shield will also be granted to allies near the wand's return location. Both passes of Prismatic Barrier cannot hit units whose center is beyond the missile range or behind its origin, even if their hitbox radius overlaps. At the return location, this behaviour is overridden by an additional center check with the same diameter as the missile width. If Lux dies before her wand returns it will fizzle upon reaching maximum range. Lux's wand decelerates on the way out and accelerates on the way back. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Prismatic Barrier is destroyed by Wind Wall and Blade Whirl but not Unbreakable . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base shield changed to 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180. AP ratio changed to 45% AP . Edit Lucent Singularity Lucent Singularity COST: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 Mana COOLDOWN : 10 / 9. 5 / 9 / 8. 5 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1100 EFFECT RADIUS: 310 / 600 SPEED: 1200 Active: Lux sends a lucent singularity to the target location, remaining there for 5 seconds to grant sight of the area and slow nearby enemies. Slow: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45% Lucent Singularity can be recast at any time while it is in flight or within the duration, and does so automatically after the duration. Recast: Lux detonates the singularity, dealing magic damage to enemies within. If Lucent Singularity was recast while in flight, it will detonate upon arrival. Magic Damage: 65 / 115 / 165 / 215 / 265 (+ 80% AP) The slow lingers for 1 second after leaving the area. Enemies hit by Lucent Singularity's detonation are also slowed by the same amount for 1 second. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location / Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. The manual recast does not. Lucent Singularity grants sight while also in flight. Edit Final Spark Final Spark COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 60 / 50 / 40 CAST TIME: 1 RANGE: 3400 WIDTH: 200 Active: Lux fires a massive laser in a line in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies hit and reveals them for 1. 5 seconds, as well as granting sight of the surrounding area.

Original View in 3D 790 19.10.2010 Luxanna Crownguard hails from Demacia, an insular realm where magical abilities are viewed with fear and suspicion. Able to bend light to her will, she grew up dreading discovery and exile, and was forced to keep her power secret, in order to preserve her family’s noble status. Nonetheless, Lux’s optimism and resilience have led her to embrace her unique talents, and she now covertly wields them in service of her homeland.

Lux's ultimate has had three names, all referencing Marisa Kirisame from Touhou Project . Finales Funkeln (German: 'final sparkle') ( V1.0.0.103 - V1.0.0.144 ) Infinite Light ( V1.0.0.144 - V1.0.0.145 ) Final Spark ( V1.0.0.145 - present, references Marisa Kirisame's Last Spell in Imperishable Night) Final Spark also references Final Flash by Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z . The Lady of Luminosity might come from Luminance Fräulein ("Lady" in German) (an ability name during production). Lux, Ezreal , and Katarina are the only champions to be visually redesigned between being announced and being released (Lux's was conceived by NA Summoner 'Katertot' aka Katie 'TeaTime' De Sousa ). Lux - Garen is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being Cassiopeia - Katarina , Kayle - Morgana , Nasus - Renekton , Yasuo - Yone , Darius - Draven , and Vi - Jinx ). Though not a pair, Anivia , Ornn , and Volibear are also siblings. The ward skin Luminosity Ward is her classic staff.
