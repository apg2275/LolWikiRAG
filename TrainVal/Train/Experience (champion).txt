Leveling up unlocks new abilities or higher ranks of existing abilities. Many base stats and some items , runes , buffs , as well as certain abilities, scale with champion level. All champions in a match start out at the same level, typically at level 1 with zero experience. Each new level requires more experience to level up than the previous level. Experience normally isn't gained passively over time, and must instead be earned through various different means. Gaining experience [ ] "Time for a shakedown." This article or section may require clean-up to meet League of Legends Wiki's quality standards . Reason given: Several errors have been detected in the following section, some of which (e.g. "minion exp range = 1600") have been misinforming users for years already. Every fact below is pending to be confirmed or corrected , once that has happened, this warning box may be removed. Please help improve the article if you can. This article was last edited by Cienkrowa on 09-Jan-2024 11:36 . There are five ways to gain experience. Takedowns : Solo killing a champion : Gives 42 − 990 (based on enemy champion level) . [1] Assisting a kill : Gives 28 − 990 (based on enemy champion level) total experience which is shared equally among all allies that participated in the kill. The experience is individually reduced by 0 / 16 / 32 / 48 / 60% (based on level difference) for being higher level than the slain champion. The experience is individually increased by 20% for each level the slain champion is higher, after a level difference of 2 (level difference can be decimal). Proximity to a champion's death while dead : Nearby enemy champion deaths grant experience up to 10 seconds after your death (whether or not you assisted in the kill). Proximity to a minion death : Being within 1400 units [2] of a minion's death grants experience, regardless of whether it was last-hit or killed by another source. Last-hitting a minion will always grant experience, regardless of distance. Proximity to a ward death : Being within 1400 units of a ward's death grants experience. Jungle monsters : Slaying a jungle camp grants experience. For the majority of monsters, all experience goes to the killer, even if there are allies nearby. Slaying Baron Nashor and Rift Herald instead grants experience to all champions of the slaying team, based on proximity for the Herald (experience given to champs within 600 units: 300) [3] - the experience gained from Baron Nashor is distributed globally [1] - and regardless if dead or alive. In the ARAM game mode, situated on the Howling Abyss map, all champions permanently possess the Howling Abyss Aura buff, which passively grants them 5 experience per second. Increasing experience gain [ ] Note that experience gain modifiers stack additively . Champion abilities [ ] Nilah's Joy Unending Zilean's Time in a Bottle Items [ ] Gustwalker Hatchling Mosstomper Seedling Rod of Ages Scorchclaw Pup Neutral buffs [ ] Howling Abyss Aura passively grants experience. Sharing experience [ ] In addition, when more than 1 champion is sharing minion or ward experience, 26. 73 % extra experience is split among all champions. Two champions each gain 61. 05 %. Three champions each gain 40. 63 %. Four champions each gain 30. 53 %. Due to a bug, when 5 or more champions are present, the experience gained by each is equal to 100% divided by the number of champions present, instead of 116% ÷ 5 = 24. 42 % at 5 champions. Five champions each gain 21. 05 %. Six champions each gain 17. 54 %. Level cap [ ] By default, and in most gamemodes, the level cap is set to level 18 . In Ultra Rapid Fire the level cap is increased to level 30 . When reaching the maximum level, the in-game tooltip for experience will show 0/0 Experience . Champions will still be able to gain experience, but it has no effect whatsoever.
