At 2 stacks, Seraphine's next basic ability casts an additional time for 1 mana after a 0. 033 seconds delay, consuming all Echo stacks after the cast time of the second cast. Seraphine gains maximum stacks of Echo when the game starts and upon respawning . Innate - Harmony: Seraphine's ability casts grant a Note to herself and nearby allied champions that lasts 6 seconds, refreshes on subsequent Notes and stacks up to 4 times on each unit. While any amount of Notes are active, Seraphine's next basic attack is empowered to have an uncancellable windup , gain 25 bonus attack range per Note , and fire all Notes at the target, with each one dealing 5 / 10 / 18 / 30 (based on level) (+ 5% AP) magic damage , reduced by 75% for Notes from allies and increased by 200% against minions . Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked Bypass Blocked Echo Details: Echo's stacks are represented by a stack counter underneath Seraphine's health bar. Seraphine's basic abilities alternate their icons between 3 different ones each, depending on the current amount of stacks she has. The additional cast must complete for Echo stacks to be consumed; if the cast time does not finish or does not begin at all, or if the ability fails to cast when there is not enough mana , Seraphine will keep her stacks. The additional cast does not affect the cooldown of the mimicked ability. The additional cast counts as a separate cast instance for the purpose of e.g. Electrocute or Conqueror . Harmony Details: Against minions, each Note from Seraphine deals 12 / 24 / 42 / 72 (based on level) (+ 18 / 21 / 24 / 27% (based on level) AP) magic damage and each note from allies deals 3 / 6 / 10. 5 / 18 (based on level) (+ 4. 5 / 5. 25 / 6 / 6. 75 % (based on level) AP) magic damage . Against non-minions, each Note from Seraphine deals normal damage and each note from allies deals 1 / 2 / 3. 5 / 6 (based on level) (+ 1. 5 / 1. 75 / 2 / 2. 25 % (based on level) AP) magic damage . Notes orbit at a radius of 100 from the center of their holder and they fire from this location. The empowered attack can critically strike . The empowered attack will not trigger against wards . Notes are fired one after another with a short delay. Seraphine can grant Notes to more than 4 allied champions. Harmony does not grant Notes to clones . Harmony grants Notes even if the ally is untargetable . The Notes will fire from allies regardless of how far they are away from Seraphine . Seraphine gains a faint blue attack range indicator when there are Notes present. Notes do not discharge when attacking wards , allowing Seraphine to attack them from increased range multiple times. Other Details: Seraphine , while alive, will play music if there is at least one ally champion nearby. This is audible to Seraphine and all allied champions that are in range of Harmony , indicative of if they can receive a Note or not. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Seraphine_IVideo.ogv Edit High Note High Note COST: 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 Mana COOLDOWN: 10 / 8. 75 / 7. 5 / 6. 25 / 5 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 900 EFFECT RADIUS: 350 SPEED: 1200 Active: Seraphine hurls a soundwave to the target location that quickly expands in a radius upon arrival, dealing magic damage to enemies within the area, increased by 0% − 50% (based on target's missing health) . Magic Damage: 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 (+ 50% AP) Increased Damage: 82. 5 / 120 / 157. 5 / 195 / 232. 5 (+ 75% AP) High Note will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked High Note uses a modified icon for the second and third stack of Stage Presence . The maximum damage of High Note uses a cosmetic critical strike . High Note will fire from wherever Seraphine is at the end of the cast time. The impact delay depends solely on the missile speed. It is 0 seconds to 0. 75 seconds (after end of cast time) within the standard cast radius, but can be increased further by Seraphine being moved away from the cast location during the cast time. PENDING FOR TEST: The area of effect is covered via expansion in several rings (similar to Frozen Tomb's area of effect) and targets can only be hit once. The range indicator for the target range has a radius of 950 units, but the center of High Note can only be cast up to 900 units. The area indicator shows the proper 350 are of effect radius and cast location. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Seraphine_QVideo.ogv Edit Surround Sound Surround Sound COST: 80 / 85 / 90 / 95 / 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 28 / 25 / 22 / 19 / 16 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 800 Active: Seraphine grants a shield to herself and nearby allied champions for 2. 5 seconds. For the same duration, she also gains 20% (+ 4% per 100 AP) decaying bonus movement speed and grants allies 8% (+ 1. 6 % per 100 AP) bonus movement speed . Shield Strength: 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 (+ 20% AP) If Seraphine already had a shield at the time of cast, Surround Sound will pulse after the duration, healing herself and nearby allied champions, increased for each ally . Heal Per Ally: 3 / 3. 5 / 4 / 4. 5 / 5% of target's missing health Surround Sound's effects can stack up to 2 times. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Auto Counters Projectile See Notes Surround Sound uses a modified icon for the second and third stack of Stage Presence . All effects are gained at the start of the cast time. Seraphine can move during the cast time. Surround Sound's shield buff can have up to 2 stacks, for a total of 200% shield strength at a time. Most shields in the game can only have one stack, refreshing their shield strength when reapplied. PENDING FOR TEST: StackingType Surround Sound will empower from any shield that Seraphine has. It does not have to be sourced from Surround Sound . Casting Surround Sound during the 2. 5 -second delay refreshes the delay. The heal affects clones and counts them for increasing the missing health percentage. A large indicator similar to Redemption's signals the heal area of effect and delay. The heal will be canceled and the indicator disappears when Seraphine dies. The heal occurs instantly on Seraphine and all nearby allied champions once the delay ends. There is a missile that flows through all allied champions which can be blocked by Wind Wall . The heal is unaffected by this. Surround Sound will affect untargetable allies. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Seraphine_WVideo.ogv Edit Beat Drop Beat Drop COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 10 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1300 WIDTH: 140 SPEED: 1200 Active: Seraphine fires a heavy soundwave in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies hit and slows them by 99% for 1. 25 seconds. Magic Damage: 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+ 35% AP) Enemies that are already slowed are also rooted for the same duration. Enemies that are immobilized or grounded are also stunned for the same duration. Hide Details Tips & Tricks Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Beat Drop will only be empowered from slows , immobilizes , and grounding effects applied by herself or her allies. Beat Drop uses a modified icon for the second and third stack of Stage Presence . Beat Drop may still be empowered even if the disable ends shortly after the ability hits. The root and the stun cannot apply at the same time. The root will only apply if the target is slowed and not immobilized or grounded . The stun will apply as normal; it does not consider if the target is slowed . The root will be overridden by the stun if the target is hit by Beat Drop again while they were rooted by it. A quarter note will appear next to an enemy champion while they are slowed and two quarter notes tied will appear if they are immobilized or grounded . This indicates if Beat Drop will apply an additional crowd control effect if it strikes the target. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Tips & Tricks The charm from Encore , which is an immobilize , can trigger the stun from Beat Drop . Beat Drop's additional effects will always trigger after the application of other crowd control effects when applied at the same time (e.g. the slow from Rylai's Crystal Scepter will always apply before Beat Drop , thus the root will always be triggered). Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Seraphine_EVideo.ogv Edit Encore Encore COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 160 / 130 / 100 CAST TIME: 0. 5 TARGET RANGE: 1200 WIDTH: 320 SPEED: 1600 Active: Seraphine projects a captivating force in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies hit, charms them, during which they are revealed , and slows them by 40% for a duration, increasing by 15% every 0. 25 seconds over the duration up to 99%. Magic Damage: 150 / 200 / 250 (+ 60% AP) Disable Duration: 1. 25 / 1. 5 / 1. 75 Encore's projectile resets its remaining travel distance whenever it hits an allied or enemy champion , excluding Seraphine . Allied champions hit gain 4 Notes . Link ▶️ Activation alert. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Encore has two cast times. Both last 0. 5 seconds. The wave will always project after the first cast time, and the second cast time only serves as a lock out for Seraphine . Seraphine cannot buffer casts during the first cast time, but she may do so during the second cast time. Clones also count for Encore's extension. Encore will not extend on enemy champions that are untargetable , but will do so for allied champions. Spell shield will also prevent Encore from extending. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Encore fires from Seraphine's location at the end of the initial cast time. There is no limit as to how many times the wave can extend. Each Encore cast cannot extend from the same champion more than once.
