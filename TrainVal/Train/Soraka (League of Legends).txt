Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Soraka will see an arrow indicating the direction in which she can gain the bonus movement speed. Edit Starcall Starcall COST: 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 Mana COOLDOWN: 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 800 EFFECT RADIUS: 265 Active: Soraka calls down a star upon the target location that grants sight of the area before landing after 0. 25 − 1 (based on target range) seconds, dealing magic damage to enemies hit and slowing them by 30% for 1. 5 seconds. Magic Damage: 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 / 225 (+ 35% AP) If this hits at least one enemy champion , the star dust returns to Soraka to grant her Rejuvenation for 2. 5 seconds. While Soraka has Rejuvenation , Astral Infusion will also grant the effects of Rejuvenation to the target ally for the same duration. Rejuvenation : The target heals every 0. 5 seconds and gains bonus movement speed that decays over the duration. Total Heal: 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 / 110 (+ 30% AP) Heal per Tick: 10 / 13 / 16 / 19 / 22 (+ 6% AP) Bonus Movement Speed: 20 / 22. 5 / 25 / 27. 5 / 30% Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Starcall counts as hitting even if it gets blocked by spell shield , granting Rejuvenation . Yasuo's Wind Wall and Braum's Unbreakable can block the Rejuvenation projectile. Rejuvenation heals over 12 ticks, with the first 4 each healing for about 15% of the heal, the next 4 ticks for about 5. 5 % each, and the last 4 for about 4. 5 % each. Rejuvenation won't be granted to Soraka and she won't be able to make use of the health cost reduction on Astral Infusion until the projectile gets to her, but she is able to Rejuvenate allies as soon as the target is hit. Edit Astral Infusion Astral Infusion COST: 10% Maximum Health + 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 Mana COOLDOWN: 6 / 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 550 Active: Soraka heals the target allied champion. Heal: 90 / 110 / 130 / 150 / 170 (+ 50% AP) If cast while under Rejuvenation , the health cost will be reduced by a percentage. Health Cost Reduction: 80 / 85 / 90 / 95 / 100% Reduced Health Cost: 2 / 1. 5 / 1 / 0. 5 / 0% of maximum health Astral Infusion cannot be cast if Soraka is below 5% of her maximum health . Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Counters Projectile Not Blocked Astral Infusion can also be targeted on allied decoys . Astral Infusion can be cast even if Soraka doesn't have the sufficient amount of health to pay for the health cost while above 5% of her maximum health . As with all abilities with health costs, Astral Infusion will not reduce Soraka's health below 1 . Spirit Visage will only increase the health donated to allies if the target ally possesses it, although owning it will boost the heal that Soraka receives from Starcall and Wish . Astral Infusion's effects occur before the cast time. Edit Equinox Equinox COST: 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90 Mana COOLDOWN: 20 / 19 / 18 / 17 / 16 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 925 EFFECT RADIUS: 260 Active: Soraka creates a celestial zone at the target location that deals magic damage to enemy champions within at the time of cast. The zone then persists for 1. 5 seconds and silences enemies within. Magic Damage: 70 / 95 / 120 / 145 / 170 (+ 40% AP) Afterwards, the zone erupts to deal the same damage to enemy champions within and root them for a duration. Total Magic Damage: 140 / 190 / 240 / 290 / 340 (+ 80% AP) Root Duration: 1 / 1. 25 / 1. 5 / 1. 75 / 2 Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield See Notes Equinox's silence is removed by cleanses but does not grant immunity to it; leaving the area and coming back inside applies the silence debuff regardless. Spell shield will not block the silence . Edit Wish Wish COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 160 / 145 / 130 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: Global Active: Soraka calls upon the stars, healing herself and all allied champions, increased by 50% on targets below 40% of their maximum health . Heal: 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 50% AP) Increased Heal: 225 / 375 / 525 (+ 75% AP) Link ▶️ "Stars hear me!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Invalid target override The ability will cast with no valid targets. Due to several character stats needing to be recalculated each time a character spawns, casting Wish immediately upon respawning will cause its cooldown to be unaffected by ability haste, and the healing will not be increased by Soraka's ability power . (bug) Untargetability does not invalidate the targeting of the heal. Wish will not credit Soraka for assisting in a champion kill if the target ally is at full health. Wish will apply heal effects (such as Summon Aery ) prioritizing targets based on the Spawn ID , which is the order in which units were added to an ongoing game. For champions , this is the order they appear in from left to right in the loading screen. Wish's effects occur before the cast time.

Original View in 3D 260 21.02.2009 A wanderer from the celestial dimensions beyond Mount Targon, Soraka gave up her immortality to protect the mortal races from their own more violent instincts. She endeavors to spread the virtues of compassion and mercy to everyone she meets—even healing those who would wish harm upon her. And, for all Soraka has seen of this world's struggles, she still believes the people of Runeterra have yet to reach their full potential. Lisa Lindsley Unknown artist Loot eligible Dryad View in 3D 520 03.06.2010 Too many forget that the heart of the Elderwood was once gentle and kind. Within its confines rested fae, sylvans, and dryads—creatures from another age, who looked upon humanity with curious eyes. Now only a scattered few remain, and fewer still, like Soraka, who regard humans fondly.

Her and her fellow banana-ites swore an oath to uphold the Order of the Banana, promising to fling the yellow produce at anyone who decided to worship a different fruit. Especially pomegranates. Lisa Lindsley Unknown artist High Society Loot eligible Program View in 3D 1350 06.04.2016 Program Soraka was created as a support bot to protect humanity's fragile nature, offering technological salvation at the hands of a mechanical angel. Infiltrated by corrupt code, it is unclear if this mission of mercy remains her prime directive.

Cafe Cuties View in 3D 1350 02.12.2021 Good food can be healing, and Soraka works hard to imbue every single pastry she makes with delicious magic that leaves her customers feeling more spritely than when they first walked in. Though her origins are mysterious, the whole cafe agrees: Soraka's work is out of this world!

Each life cut short she longed to save, but for as many that welcome her as a savior, there are others who see her power as a merciless cruelty. To the Spirit of Pity, death is never a blessing.

Remembering the old tales of God Staff Jax, who believed true power came from assuming nothing, Soraka shunned her parents' wishes to train at the Flowing Intuition School. She'll earn immortality her own way. Lisa Lindsley Bo 'chenbowow' Chen Immortal Journey Loot eligible New voiceover New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Transforming Chromas Immortal Journey Soraka Chromas Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Tanzanite Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Out-of-universe, Soraka is the romaji spelling of Japanese 空 香 "celestial fragrance", [2] a reference to Soraka's celestial nature. Soraka was one of the champions available in the Ionian pool during the Ionia vs. Noxus match . Soraka was in the previous match and had apparently performed quite poorly. In the Mac launch video, there is a banana in the weapons cabinet. This is a homage to Soraka's basic attack particle and horn, the look of which often have been compared to a banana. Soraka's dance references a commercial for Chiquita bananas. A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. In the Ultra Rapid Fire game mode (available in April 2014 ), Soraka was deemed overpowered/obnoxious, and was ultimately disabled in non-custom games. However, she was enabled in future URF and ARURF events. Wish could be a reference to the high-level mage spell "Wish" in Dungeons & Dragons. One of the functions of the Wish spell is to heal the entire party, which is very much alike to Soraka's ability. The ward skin Starcall Ward references her. The cast time of Soraka's abilities (except Equinox ) does not cancel her movement or previous orders. Soraka is one of six champions who use health as resource for their abilities, the other five being Briar , Dr. Mundo , Olaf , Vladimir , and Zac .
