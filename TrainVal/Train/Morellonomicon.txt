Old icons 1st version 2nd version 3rd version Trivia This item is named after Ryan 'Morello' Scott , former Lead Champion Designer at Riot Games Inc. The item was previously called Morello's Evil Tome . It was renamed to Morellonomicon in Season Three as a reference to both Morello and the Necronomicon , the fictional "Book of the Dead". The icon for the item prior to V3.14 has the Chinese/Japanese character for "demon/oni" (鬼; ki/oni) on the front cover. From 8.4, this item uses the icon of Pox Arcana . On the PBE for patch 8.4, this item was once renamed Morello's Cursed Tome , but it was reverted soon after. The search term 'last shadow' references LCK caster Nick De Cesare , who promoted Liandry's Torment over Morellonomicon as an effective item. [1] [2]
