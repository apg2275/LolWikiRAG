Edit Clean Cuts Clean Cuts EFFECT RADIUS: 1000 WIDTH: 120 SPEED: 4000 Innate: Feathers shot by Xayah will linger in the ground at maximum range for 6 seconds. Innate: Xayah's ability casts generate 3 stacks of Clean Cuts , lasting for 8 seconds, refreshing on subsequent casts, and stacking up to 5 times. Xayah's basic attacks are empowered to each consume a stack on-attack to instead shoot a Feather that deals the attack's damage to the primary target and 30 / 40 / 50% (based on level) AD physical damage to other enemies hit, with the secondary damage also critically striking if the main attack does. Innate - Lover's Leap: If either Xayah or Rakan is channeling Recall , the other may move nearby and channel their own to join alongside them. Both reach base at the time of which the initiator's Recall completes. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked Missing See Notes Feathers will stop upon being intercepted by projectile-blocking effects. PENDING FOR TEST: : Missile popping before and after striking the primary target. After striking their target, the attack will proceed in a line in the same direction it was already flying. If the target is more than 1000 units from Xayah when the empowered attack hits them, the attack will not keep flying in a line and drop the Feather at their location immediately. Unlike similar effects, the homing and line trajectories use the same missile. All her Feathers on the ground will be destroyed when Xayah dies , and while she is dead, missiles that are still in flight will not spawn new ones, either. Clean Cut's feathers will spawn even if the basic attack is blocked . Clean Cut's hit can be dodged by or missed against the primary target. This will not prevent the missile from continuing on its path nor from dealing damage to secondary targets. The damage cannot be dodged as or missed against a secondary target. The empowered attack will not trigger against structures nor wards . The duration will be refreshed when starting the attack windup against them. Edit Double Daggers Double Daggers COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 10 / 9. 5 / 9 / 8. 5 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 25 − 0. 1 (based on bonus attack speed) RANGE: 1100 WIDTH: 100 (plus offset) Active: Xayah barrages two Feathers in the target direction that each deal physical damage to enemies hit. Physical Damage Per Hit: 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 (+ 50% bonus AD) Total Physical Damage: 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 / 210 (+ 100% bonus AD) Targets hit after the first take 50% reduced damage. Reduced Damage per Hit: 22. 5 / 30 / 37. 5 / 45 / 52. 5 (+ 25% bonus AD) Total Reduced Damage: 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 (+ 50% bonus AD) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes See Notes Daggers shoot from Xayah's left and right side. Because of the usual tick intervals of the server, Double Daggers' minimum cast time is typically reached at 168. 58 % bonus attack speed already, for a cast time of 0. 132 seconds (from the default 0. 264 seconds ), or the duration of 4 game ticks. If the first 3 game ticks happen to be slightly longer than normal, the minimum cast time of 0. 1 seconds can actually be reached in very rare cases because of that. Xayah is unable to declare basic attacks for a set duration during the cast time of Double Daggers . The lock out duration is reduced by 「 0. 007 seconds per every 1% bonus attack speed 」 「 1 second per every 140% bonus attack speed 」 . The Feathers will stop upon being intercepted by projectile-blocking effects. As the feathers are forming, they will deal damage in a small area around Xayah's before firing. Spell shield will only block a single instance of damage. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 10 / 8. 75 / 7. 5 / 6. 25 / 5 seconds.

Bonus Attack Speed: 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55% Whenever Xayah hits an enemy champion with the strike, she gains 30% bonus movement speed for 1. 5 seconds. If Rakan is nearby upon cast, he also becomes empowered, and gains the bonus movement speed at the same time as Xayah . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Default damage Physical Counters Parries Projectile Bypass Blocked The lesser bolts count as additional sources of single target physical damage, and will apply bonus stacks of The Black Cleaver and Electrocute . The lesser bolts from Runaan's Hurricane will also deal 20% increased damage, which is represented with additional lesser bolts. The damage dealt by Deadly Plumage's bolts is 20% of the fired bolt from Runaan's Hurricane , not of the initial basic attack. The lesser bolts deal 20% of the triggering basic attack's damage, not based on her attack damage . Thus, if the basic attack is a critical strike , the lesser bolt will also deal increased damage. The empowered attack will not trigger against wards . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Second strike damage changed to 15%. Edit Bladecaller Bladecaller COST: 30 Mana COOLDOWN: 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: Global WIDTH: 160 SPEED: 4000 Active: Xayah recalls all planted Feathers to shoot back to her, each dealing physical damage to enemies hit, increased by 0% − 75% (based on critical strike chance) . Bladecaller deals 50% damage to minions . Physical Damage Per Feather: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+ 60% bonus AD) Minion Damage Per Feather: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 (+ 30% bonus AD) An enemy takes 100% − 10% (based on previous feathers hit) damage from a Feather . A target hit by at least three Feathers is rooted for 1. 25 seconds. Enemies can be hit by an individual Feather only once per pass. Link ▶️ "Gotcha!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Feathers that are 'in flight' will be called to Xayah too, but only once they've landed normally first. Spell shield will only block a single instance of damage. This ability cannot be ranked at Level 1. The damage dealt by Bladecaller follows a diminishing returns formula not mentioned in the ability's description, successively reducing extra damage from feathers beyond the first. This formula is: For feathers <=19: Damage of one feather × (n − 0. 05 × (n − 1) ÷ 2 × n) where n stands for the number of feathers hit. For feathers >=20: Damage of one feather × (19 − 0. 05 × (19 − 1) ÷ 2 × 19 + 0.1 × (n − 19)) where n stands for the number of feathers hit. For example, at rank 1 Bladecaller deals 55 − 574. 75 (based on feathers hit) . Bladecaller cannot be cast without a Feather on the ground. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage per feather changed to 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80. Bonus AD ratio per feather changed to 50% bonus AD . Edit Featherstorm Featherstorm COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 140 / 120 / 100 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 1060 / 1000 ANGLE: 30° Active: Xayah leaps into the air, becoming untargetable and ghosted for 1. 5 seconds. After 1 second, she shoots 5 Feathers in a cone in the target direction that deal physical damage to enemies hit. Physical Damage: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 100% bonus AD) Xayah is unable to basic attack or cast abilities during Featherstorm, but can still move. Link ▶️ "Feathers fly!"

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Xayah is one of 20 champions without a single ability power ratio on any ability: Aatrox , Camille , Darius , Dr. Mundo , Draven , Garen , Kayn , Kled , Naafiri , Nilah , Olaf , Pyke , Riven , Samira , Sett , Talon , Urgot , Yone , and Zed . Xayah's and Rakan's dual release is the first one since V1.0.0.72 . They were also the first champions released in 2017 . Xayah's and Rakan's loading screens always align themselves to the rightmost side before a game starts and when picked on the same team (to mirror their shared splash art). Xayah's and Rakan's dual recall animation is divided into three sections, an intro, a middle section, and then an outro. The whole sequence would take 8 seconds if Xayah and Rakan recalled at the exact same time, while the intro and the outro are both (<2 seconds). The system will always play the intro, then it will always play the outro when there is 2 seconds left in the animation, regardless of how long the middle section has played for. This means that the characters will blend from whatever position they are in, to the first pose of the outro part of the sequence. [2] Xayah does not lay eggs. [3] Xayah is the sixth dark-theme Ionian champion, the others being Shen , Varus , Syndra , Zed , Jhin , & Kayn . Bladecaller's victim is an acolyte of The Shadow Order . She has a base size of 35 which is considered small. Xayah and Rakan are likely to always receive skins together. iG Rakan however, is one exception.
