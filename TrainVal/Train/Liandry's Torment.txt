Old icons 1st version Trivia The search terms 'last shadow' and 'ls' reference LCK caster Nick De Cesare , who promoted Liandry's Torment over Morellonomicon as an effective item. [1] [2] The item was referred to as "Liandry's Lament" in several Riot posts, and is occasionally referred to as such. The item was originally going to be called "Zephyr's Lament" , but was later changed to "Liandry's Torment". The item was named after LiaNdrY, the leader of unofficial Russian client development team, which existed before official launch of Russian server. Also LiaNdrY was administrator of lolgame.ru, the biggest site dedicated to League of Legends in Runet.
