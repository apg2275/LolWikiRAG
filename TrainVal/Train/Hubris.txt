(bug) Ataraxia's tooltip says it gives 10 AD + 1 per Statue rank from Ego , but it actually gives the correct value of 15 AD + 2 per Statue rank from Ego . Upon purchasing Hubris , Ego's effect starts at rank 0. Takedowns scored before the item is bought do not count towards granting ranks. Eminence's buff is removed upon death but the ranks are not.
