Challenges tooltip now properly appears when hovering over Challenges in the Identity Customizer menu. Event Pass Evolved The final phase of The Mythic Content Overhaul has finally arrived! With the start of the Worlds 2022 Event, players will get their first look at the new Event Pass and Event Shop experiences. Event Page: We've moved event related content to one convenient location! Once you navigate here (using the special event icon at the top of the client), you'll be able to find exactly what you're looking for regarding the Event Shop, Event Pass, rewards, and more. Event Shop: Just like before, you'll be able to spend your Event Tokens on exclusive Worlds 2022 content in the Event Shop. To help you find the rewards you want to redeem most, we’ve added a navigation bar on the left side of the shop to quickly jump to categories like chromas, borders, and more. Event Pass: Overall, Event Passes are still the same. By playing games and completing missions, you'll earn rewards. Everyone will have access to free rewards, and pass buyers will unlock access to a premium set of additional rewards. However, you'll notice a slight change to how you receive your rewards. The new system has a track full of reward milestones for you to progress along and eventually claim what you've earned. Be sure to click and claim prior to the end of the event! Event Mission: Now that rewards are claimed from the new milestone track, Event Missions will now grant Event XP to help you progress and earn rewards. As a result, all players will have access to all missions, whether they've purchased the Event Pass or not. Don't worry, if you decide to purchase the pass after progressing past several milestones, you'll still be able to claim the rewards you’ve earned along the way. Event Tokens: Tokens are rewarded at each milestone on the track, and they can still be redeemed for event-exclusive content just as they always have been. Since Worlds 2022 is a BIG event, we've boosted the amount of tokens you can earn along the milestone track by adding an additional 100 free tokens spread across several milestones. Additionally, for the players that finish the milestone track, you'll be able to continue to play and earn tokens endlessly with the repeatable milestones starting at milestone 51. We've included a counter for how many times you loop this segment of the track, so keep playing and earning those rewards! Themed Clash Team formation for the second week of Worlds Clash will be open on October 10th and the tournaments will be on October 15th and 16th. In addition to the trophy, banner, and logo rewards of other Clash tournaments, Worlds Clash has an additional reward of a loot capsule. This loot capsule will contain the following: For Worlds Clash participants with premium tickets who finish between 1 - 7 place: (1) Championship Skin Permanent. For all Worlds Clash participants (premium and basic tickets) who finish 1st place: (1) World's Event Capsule. For Worlds Clash participants with premium tickets who finish between 8 - 15 place: (1) Championship Skin Shard.
