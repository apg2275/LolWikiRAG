Original View in 3D 880 17.04.2012 Hecarim is a spectral fusion of man and beast, cursed to ride down the souls of the living for all eternity. When the Blessed Isles fell into shadow, this proud knight was obliterated by the destructive energies of the Ruination, along with all his cavalry and their mounts. Now, whenever the Black Mist reaches out across Runeterra, he leads their devastating charge, reveling in the slaughter and crushing the foe beneath his armored hooves. Scott McNeil Jeremy 'Jermu' Anninos Loot eligible Blood Knight View in 3D 975 17.04.2012 A zealous sycophant to his order, Hecarim unquestioningly serves the will of the Bloodstone. While less subtle than his masters would like, he is nonetheless effective in his purpose of executing enemies in a grisly fashion. Scott McNeil Jon Neimeister, Dirty Iron, Mathias Kollros Bloodstone Loot eligible Legacy Reaper View in 3D 975 17.04.2012 When the dead refuse to take their place among the Death Sworn, the spectral knight Hecarim rides them down with his scythe at the ready. In his wake charge countless subjugated spirits, now yearning for nothing more than the reaping of fresh and defiant souls. Scott McNeil Jon Neimeister, Alex Konstad, Dirty Iron Death Sworn Loot eligible Headless View in 3D 975 26.10.2012 There are many tales told about creatures prowling the roads at night, but none are as dark as that of the headless rider. He lost his head in a duel on horseback, and is doomed to haunt the living forevermore—a hideous jack-o-lantern resting upon his shoulders. Scott McNeil Bo Lu Trick-or-Treat Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Arcade View in 3D 1350 21.08.2013 An unlikely favorite among retro purists, Hecarim has remained one of the most popular characters of the arcade era. Now he stands against the combined forces of gaming's greatest villains, proving there's no hero more noble than a rainbow-shooting chrome centaur from 1978.

Even now, Hecarim travels the shallow rivers and moss-flecked paths of the Elderwood, that ageless guardian who protects the forest from mankind's darkest yearnings. Scott McNeil Victor '3rdColossus' Maury Elderwood Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Worldbreaker View in 3D 750 10.11.2016 The third of four titans prophesied to shatter the world, Hecarim will begin his hunt when the moon smothers the sun. Riding from the south, his rampaging shadow will be cast across the land, infecting the living with dread and darkness. Scott McNeil Esben Lash Rasmussen Worldbreaker Loot eligible Lancer Zero View in 3D Special 16.08.2017 A mechanized sentinel called upon in times of war, Lancer Zero Hecarim is the protector of an ancient city—the last line of defense against the most fearsome opponents. Once unleashed, the damage it causes can be extraordinary, so it is always held back as a final, desperate gamble. Scott McNeil Xu 'Crow God' Cheng Lancer Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall High Noon View in 3D 1350 10.10.2019 When Heaven was destroyed by mortal men, it was only a matter of time until Hell overflowed onto the prairie, bringing with it all the devils who had waited so patiently to escape their confinement. Hecarim and his black riders revel in this newfound freedom, razing everything before them to ash as they stampede across the frontier.

With a voice hardened by centuries of servitude, he explained that Senna was the living embodiment of the Aurora; he, its protector. As each year passed, he guarded the borders in Polaris' absence while the new Winterblessed was chosen. It didn't matter who she was before, he told her: she'd been called to service now.

His dance references 'Dope Zebra' by 'rhettandlink' . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Warpath , along with Tailwind is one of the only two abilities in the game that scale with movement speed. Onslaught of Shadows might be referencing the fight with Ganondorf in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess . The spectral riders used to be members of the Iron Order Hecarim was Knight Commander of and, together with him, became undead when the Ruination of the Blessed Isles was unleashed. Hecarim was deemed overpowered in Ultra Rapid Fire (2014 edition) and was ultimately disabled in non-custom games.
