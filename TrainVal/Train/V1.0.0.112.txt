The most potent slow you put on a target always slows for the amount stated (full effect). Slows beyond the highest % slow still stack multiplicatively but are cut in half. Previously, diminishing returns for slows kicked in at a certain number, which meant that the first slow applied may have been hitting diminishing returns and slowing for less than intended. In general single slows will be as strong or stronger than before and multiple slows should be weaker than before. [2] [3] [4] Champions Annie General Original Annie splash art has been updated.
