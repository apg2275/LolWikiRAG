Aatrox heals for 80% of the post-mitigation bonus damage dealt, reduced to 25% against minions . Whenever Aatrox hits at least one enemy champion or large monster with a basic attack on-hit or an ability , the cooldown of Deathbringer Stance is reduced by 2 seconds, modified to 4 if he hits with the Sweetspot of The Darkin Blade . Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked While the cooldown is listed as 24-12 seconds in-game, it is actually 22-10 seconds. (bug) The cooldown gets reduced by 2 seconds when Aatrox uses the passive attack, regardless of what was hit. Aatrox will assume stance when an enemy champion is in range of Infernal Chains . Pressing CTRL + 5 switches stances controllably. If Deathbringer Stance becomes available during a standard attack's windup, it will not be consumed or trigger the bonus damage. Even if the ability hit is spell shielded Deathbringer Stance's cooldown will still be reduced. This ability goes on cooldown on death and refreshes upon respawn. The empowered attack will not trigger against structures and wards . Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Aatrox_IVideo.webm Edit The Darkin Blade The Darkin Blade COOLDOWN : 14 / 12 / 10 / 8 / 6 CAST TIME: 0. 6 RANGE: Varied Aatrox can activate The Darkin Blade three times before the ability goes on cooldown, with a 1-second static cooldown between casts. If Aatrox does not recast the ability within 4 seconds of the previous cast, it goes on cooldown. Active: Aatrox performs a strike with his greatsword for each of the three casts, dealing physical damage to enemies hit within an area. Enemies hit within a Sweetspot of the area take 60% bonus damage and also knocked up for 0. 25 seconds. Each subsequent cast increases The Darkin Blade's damage by 25%. First Cast: Aatrox's first strike affects a 625 × 180-unit rectangular area in the target direction, with him centered on the back line and the Sweetspot at the farthest edge. First Cast Damage: 10 / 25 / 40 / 55 / 70 (+ 60 / 67. 5 / 75 / 82. 5 / 90% AD) First Sweetspot Damage: 16 / 40 / 64 / 88 / 112 (+ 96 / 108 / 120 / 132 / 144% AD) Second Cast: Aatrox's second strike affects a trapezoidal area in the target direction, with the Sweetspot at the farthest edge. The hitbox begins 100-units behind Aatrox and extends 475-units in front of him, measuring between 300 and 500-units wide from behind to in front. Second Cast Damage: 12. 5 / 31. 25 / 50 / 68. 75 / 87. 5 (+ 75 / 84. 375 / 93. 75 / 103. 125 / 112. 5 % AD) Second Sweetspot Damage: 20 / 50 / 80 / 110 / 140 (+ 120 / 135 / 150 / 165 / 180% AD) Third Cast: Aatrox's third strike affects a 300-radius circular area centered on a target location that is 200 units in front of him, with a 180-radius Sweetspot within. Third Cast Damage: 15 / 37. 5 / 60 / 82. 5 / 105 (+ 90 / 101. 25 / 112. 5 / 123. 75 / 135% AD) Third Sweetspot Damage: 24 / 60 / 96 / 132 / 168 (+ 144 / 162 / 180 / 198 / 216% AD) The Darkin Blade deals 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% (based on level) damage against minions , and the knock up duration from hitting the Sweetspot is doubled to 0. 5 seconds against monsters . Maximum Non-Minion Damage: 60 / 150 / 240 / 330 / 420 (+ 360 / 405 / 450 / 495 / 540% AD) Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Blocked The highlighted areas denote the sweetspot - enemies are affected where the two areas overlap (See edge range and center range ). The first and second casts function like any point-blank AOE (i.e. an effect centered on the caster). An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on edge range - i.e. if any part of your gameplay radius is within the hitbox, you are affected. The third cast, as well as the Sweetspot for the first and second cast, function like ground-targeted abilities. An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on center range - i.e. an enemy's center has to be within the hitbox to be affected. As implied by the previous point, the Sweetspot for the first and second cast is implemented as separate areas of effect to the main component of the ability. Enemies must be within both areas to trigger the bonus damage, knock up and Deathbringer Stance's cooldown reduction. The 'target gets hit' SFX plays whenever an enemy is within the Sweetspot - meaning it is possible to trigger the sound effect without affecting an enemy. Each cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. The hitbox and Aatrox's model are fixed to the initial target direction. Aatrox's facing-direction, for effects such as Petrifying Gaze , is the direction he is moving, and not the direction the model is facing. All damage modifiers stack multiplicatively . There's a small period of time in which Aatrox can't declare basic attacks after casting The Darkin Blade . (bug) This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Type Cast time Attacking Disabled Abilities Umbral Dash can be cast. Other abilities are disabled.

Magic Damage: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 (+ 40% AD) Minion Damage: 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 (+ 80% AD) Slow: 25 / 27. 5 / 30 / 32. 5 / 35% If this hits an enemy champion or large monster , a tether is formed between the target and the ground beneath them for 1. 5 seconds, during which they are revealed . If the tether is not broken by the end of its duration, the target is dealt the same magic damage again and pulled to the center of the area. Total Damage: 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 (+ 80% AD) Hide Details Tips & Tricks Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked The impact area is oriented relative to Aatrox's position when the projectile hits, not where the projectile originated from. The location that the target is dragged to is not at the target's original location, but slightly closer towards Aatrox's position when the zone expires. There's a small delay in checking if the target is in or outside the Infernal Chains area. Because of this it is still possible to drag the target if they leave the zone at the last instant. Spell shield will block the chain's application and initial damage but not the aftereffects of one already applied. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Tips & Tricks To succesfully escape when moving in a straight line away from Aatrox requires at least 628 movement speed . Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Aatrox_W_Video.webm Edit Umbral Dash Umbral Dash COOLDOWN: 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 75 / 300 / 500 SPEED: 800 / Up to 1340 Passive: Aatrox heals for a portion of the non- persistent post-mitigation damage he deals against enemy champions, increased during World Ender . Healing: 18 / 19. 5 / 21 / 22. 5 / 24% World Ender Increased Healing: 20 / 24 / 28 / 32 / 36% Active: Aatrox dashes in the target direction. Umbral Dash resets Aatrox's basic attack timer and can be cast during his other abilities without cancelling them and vice versa. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Location Insufficient dash range Dash will gain bonus range through terrain. Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted The dash distance can be extended to up-to 500 units when targeting across terrain. It will only extend for the distance needed to cross the wall. This may upscale his dash speed so that the dash takes the same total time as the standard maximum-range dash. If Umbral Dash is cast in the same direction Aatrox is moving, he will be unable to buffer commands that require him to move. (bug) Aatrox's model darkens for 1. 5 seconds upon casting Umbral Dash , which is a remnant from a buff he received before it got removed.

He also gains ghosting and bonus movement speed that decays by 10% of the current bonus every 0. 25 seconds, lasting until World Ender has ended. Bonus Movement Speed: 60 / 80 / 100% Whenever Aatrox scores a champion takedown , he extends the duration by 5 seconds and becomes unleashed again. During World Ender , Aatrox gains bonus attack damage and 5% increased size , and receives increased self-healing from all sources.

Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Auto His resource bar indicates the remaining duration of World Ender . World Ender persists through resurrection effects. World Ender's healing amplification applies to the health gained by resurrecting. World Ender will cast from wherever Aatrox is at the end of the cast time. Casting World Ender while it is still active renders Aatrox's wings invisible and removes the timer on the resource bar. (bug) This is possible via Axiom Arc's or Practice Tool's cooldown reduction or by going on a very long killing spree.

Original View in 3D 880 12.06.2013 Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void, Aatrox and his brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra, and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Aatrox, the Darkin Blade Out-of-universe, Aatrox is a word play on Latin atrox "fierce, savage, cruel" in turn from ater "dull black, dark", from root PIE *h₂eh₁ter- "fire"; [2] All of these reference the Darkin weapon's physical manifestation and demonic nature (punning on dark kin ), various historical fire-based weapons , the scorched earth strategy, and his ' war as an artform ' philosophy. Latin atrox gives rise to Anglo-French atrocity. Aatrox, Dr. Mundo , Mordekaiser , Vladimir , and Zac are the only champions that use their own health as a resource for abilities . Enemies hit by Massacre will leave a blood trail between themselves and Aatrox that he will rapidly absorb (this is a remaining visual effect from PBE testing, where Aatrox would gain attack speed based on how many enemies had been hit by Massacre , that was recycled in V5.6 ). Aatrox can still use emotes during Blood Well's revive. Sterak's Gage is speculated to have been Aatrox's missing left arm glove. Its passive was also coincidentally similar to Aatrox's. Prior to his rework, on the statement "This champion needs an update", players ranked Aatrox 5th in NA; 4th in BR; 3rd in KR and 14th in CN. He ranked 4th overall. [3] Aatrox, the Darkin Blade Aatrox is the first champion, since Lulu's patch introduced champion specific login screens , to receive two login screens and themes released for his Classic skin. In-game, Aatrox can toggle his banner-style wings and his sword stance [default: Ctrl + 5]. Aatrox is one of 20 champions without a single ability power ratio on any ability: Camille , Darius , Dr. Mundo , Draven , Garen , Kayn , Kled , Naafiri , Nilah , Olaf , Pyke , Riven , Samira , Sett , Talon , Urgot , Xayah , Yone , and Zed . The icon for World Ender is reused for the Teamfight Tactics item Darkin . Aatrox's Series 1 Eternals make the following references: Chains Yanked references the idiom yank one's chain as well as the pull of Infernal Chains . QQ's references the QQ emoticon as well the multi-cast nature of The Darkin Blade .
