Blighted Quiver can be cast during the first 0. 25 seconds of Piercing Arrow's charge, and will be placed on full cooldown even if Piercing Arrow is not recast. Recast: Varus ends Blighted Quiver and places it on a 1-second cooldown. Blighted Quiver's active and recast can both be used while affected by cast-inhibiting crowd control .

Edit Chain of Corruption Chain of Corruption COST: 100 mana COOLDOWN: 100 / 80 / 60 CAST TIME: 0. 2419 RANGE: 1370 EFFECT RADIUS: 650 WIDTH: 240 TETHER RADIUS: 650 SPEED: 1500 Active: Varus unleashes a tendril of corruption in the target direction that infects the first enemy champion hit, dealing magic damage and rooting them for 2 seconds, during which they are revealed . Over the first 1. 5 seconds, they are also inflicted with maximum stacks of Blight . Magic Damage: 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 100% AP) Upon impact, the tendril roots into the ground from which it seeks out nearby enemy champions . If a target does not leave the area within 2 seconds, they subsequently become infected as well, taking the same damage and effects. A new tendril is then spread out from the infected target that is closest to a nearby uninfected enemy champion. The infection can spread repeatedly until there are no new targets. The target does not have to be visible to be caught by the tendril. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Enemy champions can be targeted again by the corruption's tether if they were not infected the previous time, even if they were targeted and got out of range. A tendril that roots into the ground will only seek nearby enemy champions that were already in the area. Chain of Corruption will not infect crowd control immune targets or those protected by spell shields (but will still seek them). Varus will turn to face the target direction at the start of the cast. The tendril cannot seek enemy champions that are untargetable . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Consuming the Blight's stacks applied by Chain of Corruption will deal bonus magic damage based on Blighted Quiver's rank. If the ability hasn't been ranked yet, the three Blight stacks will still be applied but they will be considered to be at rank 0, dealing 1. 25 % (+ 2% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health per stack.

Original View in 3D 880 08.05.2012 One of the ancient darkin, Varus was a deadly killer who loved to torment his foes, driving them almost to insanity before delivering the killing arrow. He was imprisoned at the end of the Great Darkin War, but escaped centuries later in the remade flesh of two Ionian hunters—they had unwittingly released him, cursed to bear the bow containing his bound essence. Varus now seeks out those who trapped him, in order to enact his brutal vengeance, but the mortal souls within still resist him every step of the way.

Varus became an amalgam of crystal, monster, and man—now fracturing the world he once sought to make safe.

Gavin Hammon Jeremy Chong, West Studio Snow Moon Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Snow Moon Varus Chromas Amethyst Citrine Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Varus was the first champion to be released in Season Two with only one alternative skin, with subsequent champions following this pattern. Varus' title " The Arrow of Retribution" strongly resembles Kalista's title "The Spear of Vengeance" . Varus is, along with Blitzcrank , Caitlyn , Lissandra , Rumble , Sion , Vi , Xerath , and Ziggs , one of the few champions that can apply crowd control on themselves. Varus' body style is similar to the one of Solus , the T'Lan leader from the game Breakdown . Varus is the first of three dark-themed champions with a light-themed skin, the second being Syndra and the third being Aatrox . Of these three, Varus' skin is the only one not of the Justicar theme. Varus is the only Darkin champion whose abilities currently have ability power ratios. This is most likely because Varus was retconned into being a Darkin in 2017, 5 years after his release in 2012. Prior to his rework in Season 8, Aatrox also had an ability power ratio on his then-ultimate, Massacre.
