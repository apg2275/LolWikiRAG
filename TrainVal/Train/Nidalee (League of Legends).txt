The damage amplification is based on the distance from Nidalee's location at the end of the cast time to the struck target's center at the time of collision. The damage increase is very slightly higher than the spear's travel distance due to edge range behaviour of collisions and the distance being measured as the radius from the picked "origin" location at the end of the cast time, rather than just along the vector of the cast. The damage increase does not have distinct thresholds based on the distance the spear travelled. Picking Nidalee's location at the end of the cast time as the "origin" for the damage calculation may be unintended.

Neither wholly woman nor beast, she viciously defends her territory from any and all trespassers, with carefully placed traps and deft spear throws. She cripples her quarry before pouncing on them in feline form—the lucky few who survive tell tales of a wild woman with razor-sharp instincts, and even sharper claws...

Some within the Warring Kingdoms say she fights with the wild ferocity of a white tiger, that the tiger's spirit dwells within her heart. Others believe she is the white tiger, that she can become the beast itself.

Nidalee, Elise , Gnar , Jayce , and Kayle Samira are the only champions to be both ranged and melee . Nidalee is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in per skin (one for human form and another matching one for cougar). Nidalee was the first champion to feature a transformation ability (the others being Elise , Gnar Shyvana , and Swain ). Nidalee has four running animations (human run, human brush sprint, cougar run, cougar brush sprint). Pounce was the first ability to feature a static cooldown (was removed in V1.0.0.124 ). Nidalee used to have a hidden passive where nearby allied champions gain 5 bonus experience every 5 seconds if Nidalee is higher-leveled . After Fiddlestick get reworked, A maximum-range Javelin Toss has the highest damage of any single-targeted basic ability in-game (Only surpassed by the pre-rework, fully charged Drain ) and higher damage than many ultimate abilities. Nidalee was deemed overpowered/obnoxious in the Ultra Rapid Fire game mode (2014 edition) and was ultimately disabled in non-custom games. After her visual rework, her feline forms received morphological features from cougars' bigger relatives , like mane, higher shoulders than haunches, long skull & jaws, & occasionally long fangs of sabre-toothed cats and other cat-like relatives . The game client's shop filters Nidalee as a Support despite her no longer having that tag as a secondary one. Nidalee is one of the first champions to have one skin for each of the three big annual events of the year - Lunar Revel , Harrowing and Snowdown Showdown . She and Katarina received their Warring Kingdoms as their last skin in 2015. The other one is Jinx with her Ambitious Elf Jinx in 2017. Annie finishes her last skin ( Panda ) in 2013. But her Frostfire Annie skin were not released during the Snowdown Showdown event. Given that she's a wild child , it is unknown how Nidalee could've learnt to speak languages fluently; since in real life, feral humans who learn their first language late in life never master such linguistic aspects like phonology, morphology, and syntax.
