Void Shift: Malzahar gains crowd control immunity and 90% damage reduction. Void Shift's cooldown refreshes whenever Malzahar takes non- minion damage or is affected by a crowd control effect, and resets upon respawning . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Void Shift will not resist allied crowd control nor will it be deactivated by them. Void Shift will not mitigate true damage but the buff will still be consumed. It does not deactivate against the Nexus Obelisk . Shields will take priority over Void Shift , but the buff will still be consumed (does not reduce damage inflicted). Void Shift triggers even if the shield negated the damage entirely. However, if Malzahar has a spell shield and the shield fully mitigates the damage, Void Shift does not trigger. (bug) The damage taken must be from an effect that cannot be negated by spell shields . Spell shields take priority over Void Shift . If the triggering hostile ability does not contain a crowd control effect, both Void Shift and the spell shield break simultaneously. Since spell shields are precedent over Void Shift , applied crowd control from effects that cannot be blocked by spell shields (i.e. Wall of Pain ) will also ignore Void Shift despite its crowd control immunity . The effect must not damage Malzahar for this event to take place. Void Shift will specifically not deactivate if Malzahar eats Honeyfruit or is within a hostile Frozen Heart passive aura . Void Shift will prevent Chum the Waters from attaching to him. Edit Call of the Void Call of the Void COST: 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 6 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 900 EFFECT RADIUS: 200 Active: Malzahar opens two portals to the void centered at the target location, granting sight of the area in between.

Active: Malzahar consumes all Zz'Rot Swarm stacks and, after a 0. 5 -second delay, summons a Voidling at the target location. Additional Voidlings are then summoned for each Zz'Rot Swarm stack consumed. Voidling Duration: 8 / 8 / 9 / 9 / 10 Voidlings deal magic damage with their attacks, reduced by 50% against epic monsters and increased by 200% to enemy minions infected by Malefic Visions . Magic Damage: 5 − 64. 5 (based on level) (+ 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20) (+ 40% bonus AD) (+ 20% AP) See Pets for more details about Voidlings. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Malzahar loses all stacks upon death . Zz'Rot Swarm stacks are gained per cast and not per ability activation.

Total Magic Damage: 10 / 15 / 20% (+ 2. 5 % per 100 AP) of target's maximum health Magic Damage Per Tick: 1 / 1. 5 / 2% (+ 0. 25 % per 100 AP) of target's maximum health Null Zone will persist even if the channel is interrupted.

Original View in 3D 880 01.06.2010 A zealous seer dedicated to the unification of all life, Malzahar truly believes the newly emergent Void to be the path to Runeterra’s salvation. In the desert wastes of Shurima, he followed the voices that whispered in his mind, all the way to ancient Icathia. Amidst the ruins of that land, he gazed into the dark heart of the Void itself, and was gifted new power and purpose. Malzahar now sees himself as a shepherd, empowered to bring others into the fold… or to release the voidling creatures that dwell beneath.

There, after suffering a life-changing revelation, he became its greatest messenger, claiming to see prophecies of the coming of a second hextech renaissance. Vic Mignogna Xu 'Crow God' Cheng Hextech Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Worldbreaker View in 3D 1350 09.04.2020 With the world revitalized, there came another wave of titans. Most fearsome of all was Malzahar, the once-great protector of animals. Vengeful over the horrors of the previous extinction, the holy shaman succumbed to anger, and there, in the depths of his rage, his magic turned dark, fueling a fury to end all life—from the depths of the seas to the peaks of mountains.

Malzahar is one of the few champions to have a pet , the others being Annie , Elise , Heimerdinger , Ivern , Shaco , and Yorick . Malzahar and his Voidlings' dance references U Can't Touch This by MC Hammer . A side-by-side comparison for Malzahar's part can be seen here . A side-by-side comparison for his Voidlings' part can be seen here . He shares this dance (specifically his Voidlings' part) with Jayce . Upon the removal of Zz'Rot Portal in patch V9.23 , Gathering Swarm stacks for Void Swarm was renamed to Zz'Rot Swarm to honor the item. This might indirectly imply that Malzahar's voidlings are a similar if not the same species as the Voidspawn that spawned from that item. Malzahar's Voidling had its assets reused for several rotating game modes . It was given a retexture and features as a monster in Invasion . Its animations were reused for the Cyte monster in Odyssey: Extraction .
