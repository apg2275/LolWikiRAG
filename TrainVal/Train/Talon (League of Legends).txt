Talon's next basic attack against an enemy with 3 Wound stacks is empowered to consume them all to cause the target to bleed, dealing 「 80 − 280 (based on level) (+ 210% bonus AD) total physical damage over 2 seconds, 」 「 5 − 17. 5 (based on level) (+ 13. 125 % bonus AD) physical damage every 0. 125 seconds over 2 seconds, 」 increased to 120% damage against monsters .

If Noxian Diplomacy is cast within close range, Talon instead stabs the target to critically strike for (50% + 40% ) bonus physical damage , as well as gain 75 bonus attack range on his next basic attack within 1 second. Physical Damage: 65 / 85 / 105 / 125 / 145 (+ 100% bonus AD) If Noxian Diplomacy kills the target, Talon heals for 9 − 55 (based on level) and the ability's cooldown is reduced by 50%. Noxian Diplomacy resets Talon's basic attack timer. Shadow Assault can be cast during the dash. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked See Notes Interrupted Talon will track the target if they change locations, landing at an offset of 100 units before reaching them. He will dash to the target's previous location while still dealing damage if the target is too far away or moves beyond 800 units. Talon will be ordered to basic attack the target at the end of the dash. While grounded or rooted , Noxian Diplomacy can only be cast within stab range. Noxian Diplomacy will also grant the heal if the target dies upon Talon's completion of the dash. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). This only applies to the stab version. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Bonus AD ratio changed to 130% bonus AD .

Physical Damage: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 (+ 40% bonus AD) At maximum range, the daggers linger for 0. 75 seconds before homing back to Talon , dealing physical damage to enemies hit and slowing them for 1 second.

Enemies can be hit only once per pass. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Casting Rake when an enemy is within 650 radius and 26° angle in front of Talon will reveal him from the fog of war like a targeted cast. (bug) This is because of Rake's internal Cone targeting type, which defaults to "targeting" all units in the preset area and thereby trigger revealing the caster if not toggled off for the spell. If Talon dies while Rake is mid-air, the projectiles will still complete their travel. The blades each will fail to return to Talon if he is somehow too far from them after the delay. This maximum distance is 5000 units at ranks 1-4 of Rake , or 20000 units at rank 5 of Rake . (bug) The latter distance is barely achievable between fountains on Summoner's Rift.

Physical Damage: 90 / 135 / 180 (+ 100% bonus AD) Bonus Movement Speed: 40 / 55 / 70% Shadow Assault can be recast after 1 second within the duration, and does so automatically after the duration or if Talon emerges from invisibility. Recast: Talon ends Shadow Assault , breaking the invisibility and causing the blades to converge to him, dealing the same damage to enemies hit. Breaking invisibility with a basic attack or Noxian Diplomacy causes the blades to converge to the target instead.

Spell shield will block a single pass. Shadow Assault does not cancel Talon's basic attacks. Shadow Assault has a minimum lifetime of 0.8 seconds before convergence. The blades each will fail to converge on their target ( Talon or the attacked target) if the target is more than 20000 units from them.

Original View in 3D 880 24.08.2011 Talon is the knife in the darkness, a merciless killer able to strike without warning and escape before any alarm is raised. He carved out a dangerous reputation on the brutal streets of Noxus, where he was forced to fight, kill, and steal to survive. Adopted by the notorious Du Couteau family, he now plies his deadly trade at the empire’s command, assassinating enemy leaders, captains, and heroes… as well as any Noxian foolish enough to earn the scorn of their masters.

Noxian Diplomacy's bleed icon is shaped into Talon's arm blade. Cutthroat makes use of a double entendre : The word ' cutthroat ' is defined as murderous or cruel, which describes Talon well. The ability has Talon literally cut the throat of his target. This is made more clear in the first iteration of the ability, which also silenced the target. Talon, the Blade's Shadow Talon is one of 20 champions without a single ability power ratio on any ability: Aatrox , Camille , Darius , Dr. Mundo , Draven , Garen , Kayn , Kled , Naafiri , Nilah , Olaf , Pyke , Riven , Samira , Sett , Urgot , Xayah , Yone , and Zed . His official name Talon originates from Latin talus " ankle "; which possibly later underwent semantic shift to " heel > spur > claw ". His title might be referencing his loyalty to General Du Couteau (the General being the 'Blade' - couteau is French for 'knife' - and Talon being the 'Shadow'). Talon's dance references Billie Jean by Michael Jackson . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Some scrapped spells tested on Talon include: [2] [3] [4] A spell where Talon throws out knives to create a slow field, but if he left its proximity it would break the field. A spell where Talon could throw out a knife that could be reactivated and allow him to blink to its location. Shadow Assault was originally tested as a basic spell. Talon was named after his bird like appearance and his large hand blade. His spells carry a metaphor by utilizing the concept of his cloak blades as a string of “feathers”.
