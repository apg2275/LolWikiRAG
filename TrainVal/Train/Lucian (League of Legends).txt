He will shoot the same target, else another target in range. The second shot applies on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectiveness and is affected by critical strike modifiers. Innate - Vigilance: Whenever Lucian is healed or shielded by an ally, or an enemy champion within 1000 units is immobilized , his next two shots within 6 seconds are empowered to deal 15 (+ 15% AD) bonus magic damage on-hit . He can store up to 4 empowered shots at a time. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Basic damage Physical Drawn Counters Parries Blocked Lightslinger is triggered and consumed by the first attack, even if no target can be found upon firing the second attack. The second attack, if the initial target was killed, will prioritize enemy champions regardless of having sight of them or not and enemy minions with low health . Lucian can perform actions freely while firing Lightslinger since the second attack is integrated into the first one. The second attack has special movement animations depending on the direction Lucian is moving while firing. The second attack counts as a separate hit for effects such as Electrocute , Muramana's Shock , and Eclipse's Ever Rising Moon . The second attack separately rolls critical strike . The empowered shots will apply against structures. Edit Piercing Light Piercing Light COST: 48 / 56 / 64 / 72 / 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 CAST TIME: 0. 4 − 0. 25 (based on level) TARGET RANGE: 500 RANGE: 1000 WIDTH: 120 Active: Lucian fires a laser in a line in the direction of the target enemy that deals physical damage to enemies hit. Physical Damage: 95 / 125 / 155 / 185 / 215 (+ 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120% bonus AD) Piercing Light's cast time ends prematurely if the initial target dies, allowing Lucian to attack and move freely, or to immediately begin casting either Ardent Blaze or The Culling . (bug) Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Piercing Light will attempt to lead the target if it is moving but does not adjust further during the cast time (enemies can dodge the laser if they change their position by a sufficient amount during the cast time). Lucian can buffer Ardent Blaze or The Culling during the cast time. Relentless Pursuit is locked out. This is why Lucian can use them early if the cast time prematurely ends. Edit Ardent Blaze Ardent Blaze COST: 60 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 900 WIDTH: 110 SPEED: 1600 Active: Lucian fires a missile in the target direction that explodes in a cross pattern upon hitting an enemy or reaching maximum range, dealing magic damage to enemies hit and granting sight of the area for 1 second. Magic Damage: 75 / 110 / 145 / 180 / 215 (+ 90% AP) Enemies hit are marked for 6 seconds. Lucian gains bonus movement speed for 1 second when he or allied champions damage a marked target. Allied champions triggering this effect grant Lucian Vigilance . Bonus Movement Speed: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile See Notes See Notes Blocked This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Like most missiles , it will not collide with enemies whose center is beyond the maximum range (not behind Lucian ), but this determines only the center and timing of the explosion. Ardent Blaze will cast from wherever Lucian is at the end of the cast time. Lucian will not gain Ardent Blaze's bonus movement speed if attacks on marked targets are dodged , blocked , or if missed while the attacker is blinded . DoTs will proc Ardent Blaze only once. Spell shield will not prevent the mark. Edit Relentless Pursuit Relentless Pursuit COST: 40 / 30 / 20 / 10 / 0 Mana COOLDOWN: 19 / 17. 75 / 16. 5 / 15. 25 / 14 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 425 / 200 SPEED: 1350 Passive: Relentless Pursuit's current cooldown is reduced by 1 second for each Lightslinger shot hit, doubled to 2 seconds against enemy champions . Active: Lucian dashes in the target direction. Relentless Pursuit resets Lucian's basic attack timer. Lucian can cast any of his abilities during the dash. Relentless Pursuit can be cast during Ardent Blaze's cast time and during The Culling's channel. Relentless Pursuit will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted Additional on-hits during Lightslinger are not considered for the cooldown reduction (i.e Runaan's Hurricane , Guinsoo's Rageblade ). Unlike some dashes, Lucian's dash speed does not scale with his movement speed . Relentless Pursuit's dash can go through terrain, but will not be extended further if the target location is within terrain, unlike other dashes, like Ekko 's Phase Dive . Casting Relentless Pursuit directly after attacking with Lightslinger will reduce Relentless Pursuit's cooldown when the projectiles hit the target. With Navori Quickblades and 10 more ability haste, attacking a champion with Lightslinger , followed by Relentless Pursuit , and another Lightslinger attack will fully reset rank 5 Relentless Pursuit's cooldown. Relentless Pursuit can be cast during Recall's cast time. If Relentless Pursuit is cast just as the cast time ends, Lucian will not perform his Recall animation, instead staying idle. This allows Lucian to use his emotes during his Recall. Edit The Culling The Culling COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 110 / 100 / 90 CAST TIME: none RANGE: 1200 / 1140 (plus offset) WIDTH: 220 (plus offset) Active: Lucian channels for up to 3 seconds, rapidly firing up to 22 (+ 1 per 4% critical strike chance) shots in the target direction. Each shot deals physical damage to the first enemy hit, doubled against minions . The Culling can be recast after 0. 75 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically when the channel ends. Physical Damage Per Shot: 15 / 30 / 45 (+ 25% AD) (+ 15% AP) Additional Damage per 20% Crit Chance: 75 / 150 / 225 (+ 125% AD) (+ 75% AP) Total Physical Damage: 330 / 660 / 990 (+ 550% AD) (+ 330% AP) + 15 / 30 / 45 (+ 25% AD) (+ 15% AP) per 4% critical strike chance Minion Damage Per Shot: 30 / 60 / 90 (+ 50% AD) (+ 30% AP) Additional Minion Damage per 20% Crit Chance: 150 / 300 / 450 (+ 250% AD) (+ 150% AP) Total Minion Damage: 660 / 1320 / 1980 (+ 1100% AD) (+ 660% AP) + 30 / 60 / 90 (+ 50% AD) (+ 30% AP) per 4% critical strike chance While channeling, Lucian is ghosted and may still move. Recast: Lucian ends The Culling . Link ▶️ "For Senna !" Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction / Auto Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Disruption See Notes Blocked Interrupted At 100% critical strike chance , The Culling fires up to 25 additional shots, for a total of 47 shots. The total damage at the maximum number of shots (at 100% critical strike chance ) is 705 / 1410 / 2115 (+ 1175% AD) (+ 705% AP) physical damage . Against minions, this is increased to 1410 / 2820 / 4230 (+ 2350% AD) (+ 1410% AP) . The fire rate increases with the number of shots. During The Culling , Lucian's facing direction is in the direction that he is firing. Lucian can interact with Dark Passage or allied Devour without interrupting The Culling . The Culling creates the shots at an offset of 35 units to the front plus 35 units towards each side of Lucian (sides alternating, first shot fired from Lucian's right gun), unlike the missiles of most abilities. The damage dealt by each bullet of The Culling is calculated when the bullet reaches a target, just like single missile abilities. Spell shield only blocks one instance of damage.

TJ Storm Huyy Nguyen, West Studio Winterblessed Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Winterblessed Lucian Chromas Aquamarine Citrine Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Wreathguard Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Lucian's is the first login screen to start with an animated sequence (his shows his wife Senna's soul being dragged into Thresh's lantern ). The Culling used to be the first ability in the game to directly scale with attack speed (until V5.22 ) and is the first that allows firing backwards while moving. Lucian's recalling references Equilibrium . A side by side comparison can be seen here. The sloped front of Lucian's guns is also very reminiscent of the weapons wielded by the Clerics in Equilibrium. Lucian's dance references Revolver Ocelot's gun spinning from Metal Gear . A side by side comparison can be seen here. Lucian was the first champion to ever get a Chroma Pack for his Classic skin. Of Lucian's guns the less ornate one is his (an L is engraved on its side) and the more intricate one was Senna's (an S instead); [2] the letters were at first thought to mean Light and Shadow . People in Lucian's social circle possess light-theme names: Lucian derives from Latin praenomen Lucius , from lux (cognate with English light ), sharing one same PIE root *leuk- as Luxanna . Senna from Arabic سناء Sanāʼ "brightness, sublimity", [3] from root s-n-y (> Sin "moon" & seneh " burning bush "). [4] Lucian's father's name Urias Ουριας is the Greek rendition of Hebrew אוריה Uriah "my light [5] is Yah ". Lucian and Zed perform the 'Naruto run' when having very high movement speed. If Senna and Thresh are played on opposing teams, a quest will trigger for Lucian as well. This in-game quest consists of a battle of himself vs Thresh to earn the opposing champion's stack of souls, Lucian's death will grant Senna's stacks to Thresh.
