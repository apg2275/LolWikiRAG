Abilities Flame Aura Tibbers deals 5 / 7. 5 / 10 (+ 3% AP) magic damage to all enemies within a 350 unit radius every 0. 25 seconds. Recovery While out of combat for at least 5 seconds Tibbers heals himself for 6% maximum health per second and gains 250 bonus movement speed when moving towards Annie's location from further than 600 units away, decreased to 100 bonus movement speed from further than 150 units. Enrage Tibbers enrages for 3 seconds on summon and when Pyromania stuns an enemy champion . During this time, Tibbers becomes ghosted and gains 100% bonus movement speed , which decays over the duration. His base attack speed is also increased to 1. 736 for his next 5 attacks while enraged, but decreasing with each attack until returning at his normal attack speed. There can be two formulas that can display Tibbers' attack speed with approximated values: 「 1. 736 / 1. 536 / 1. 307 / 1. 043 / 0. 739 (based on Attacks Consumed) 」 「 1. 736 / 1. 536 / 1. 307 / 1. 043 / 0. 739 (based on Attacks Consumed) 」 . Revenge If Annie dies while Tibbers is active, he instantly heals himself for 50% of his missing health , becomes enraged for 10 seconds, and will target Annie's killer. His health will rapidly decay over time and if Annie's killer is too far away, he'll target the nearest lowest-health enemy champion instead.

Original View in 3D 260 21.02.2009 Dangerous, yet disarmingly precocious, Annie is a child mage with immense pyromantic power. Even in the shadows of the mountains north of Noxus, she is a magical outlier. Her natural affinity for fire manifested early in life through unpredictable, emotional outbursts, though she eventually learned to control these 'playful tricks.' Her favorite includes the summoning of her beloved teddy bear, Tibbers, as a fiery protector. Lost in the perpetual innocence of childhood, Annie wanders the dark forests, always looking for someone to play with.
