Ranked Changes The midpoint of Emerald tier is being adjusted to have a smaller population overall. This reduces instances of net LP losses being larger than net LP gains on generally positive winrates (i.e., at ranks Emerald and above). Baseline LP gain/loss is increased to  ± 28 in the visible ranks of Emerald and below. Baseline LP gain/loss is reduced by up to 8 points for players in the visible ranks of Emerald and above. This should equate to an average of about  ± 20 when rank and MMR match, in those tiers. Matchmaking now searches in a slightly tighter range of visible ranks. This reduces exceptional instances of large visible rank disparities among players in the given lobby. Demoting from a tier now takes less games in order to solve large MMR disparities when having negative MMR. Updated matchmaking algorithms and rank placement for new players to better reflect their skill level. The rank placement baseline for first-time ranked has also been lowered. Challenges The following challenges have been added for Season 2024, Split 1: Legendary Arms: Win Games with Legendary Items Support Subsidy: Fully complete your support quest in 14 minutes Crab Wrangler: Take both of the first Scuttle Crab spawns The Brush Has Eyes: End the game with 20% more vision score than your role opponent All Random All Champs: Earn an S- grade on different champions Wurm Fishing: Take down Barons Right Under Their Noses: Recall while unseen by an enemy champion Always On Time: Kill Epic Monsters within 30 seconds of spawn Spectator Mode The spectator paradigm for live games has been changed: New: After clicking to spectate, the user is required to wait an amount of time equivalent to the spectator delay for each game mode (respectively) before loading in. Upon loading, they will be able to view the game from the time they started loading in. The ability to view earlier gameplay has been removed. Old: Spectators can view up to the last 5 minutes of gameplay prior to when they loaded into spectator, which may differ regionally. New: Arena and TFT matches can now be spectated live. The spectator delay for both is 60 seconds. Summoner's Rift spectator delay reduced to 150 seconds from 180. ARAM spectator delay reduced to 60 seconds from 180. Game [ ] Dynamic Music This functionality allows for different pieces and/or styles of music to play in different contexts of the game. The system can be broken down into 3 components, Locational Music, Contextual Music, and Situational Music. Locational Music: Changes with your champion's current location on the map. Virtual musical "zones" are being introduced into Summoner's Rift that will play different music for different locations within the map as you enter them. Currently this will only exist for the top side river. Contextual Music: Changes with the current game state. The default Summoner's Rift theme will musically evolve as new objectives spawn, with there being a total of 4 evolution states: Neutral (pre-Voidgrub/nothing has spawned in the baron pit). Voidgrubs have arrived. Rift Herald has arrived. Baron Nashor has arrived. Situational Music: Changes with your current actions. There is now unique music that overrides the Summoner's Rift theme during an initiated combat encounter with each unique camp in the baron pit. Emotes New: Fist Bumps Raise your fist by pressing the designated hotkey (default: U ). The fist remains for 5 seconds. Allies can raise their fist as well, and a fist bump between all of them will be performed after 4 seconds of idling. If the emoting allies are further apart, a fist bump emote will play for each one individually instead. If someone has raised their first, this is broadcast next to the ally portraits on the HUD, displaying the timer, hotkey, and whether or not you are participating in the cheer. If there is no valid ally nearby at the end of the timer, the fist performs a unique thumbs-up before disappearing. Lethality Removed: Armor penetration no longer scales by 62. 22 % − 100% (based on level) of its value based on your level. Now grants flat armor penetration equal to its value at all levels. Quests Additional in-game quests between champions have been added as easter eggs: Bad Blood - Nasus vs. Renekton Quest Conditions: Both champions have to be on opposing teams and at least level 11, with their ultimate abilities activated ( Nasus' Fury of the Sands and Renekton's Dominus ).

The damage dealt by his Contempt for the Weak is increased by an additional 2% of the target's maximum health .

Viego Sovereign's Domination Bug Fix: Heartbreaker is no longer sometimes replaced by Spiraling Despair while possessing Hwei . Items [ ] For the list of all major item changes lauching with the start of Season 2024, see V14.1/Items Jungle pets Non-epic monster bonus damage reduced to 25% from 42%. Base damage increased to 20 − 90 (based on level) from 15. 5 at all levels. New Effect: Damage to epic monsters is now capped at 16 − 40 (based on level) . Eye of the Herald Updated icon. New Effect: Upon picking up the Eye of the Herald , the holder and any of their allies who participated in slaying the pit Rift Herald gain an Empowered Recall Charge . The charge is consumed once the next channel completes and lasts indefinitely otherwise. No longer only grants an Empowered Recall Charge to the holder. New Effect: If the trinket expires before being used, it is automatically consumed to summon the Mercenary after a 0. 033 -seconds delay. New Effect: If the trinket expires while the user is dead, the Mercenary is automatically summoned at their team's spawn. New Effect: The Mercenary now grants her kill credit to the champion who summoned her as well as the slayer's allies if they participated in her takedown as the pit Rift Herald . New Effect - Rift Herald Rodeo: After summoning the Mercenary , the user or one of their allied champions can target the monster to immediately become untargetable , invulnerable , displacement immune , and unable to act , and wind up for 0. 75 seconds to attach themselves to the monster and "ride" it for up to 12. 5 seconds. Once a champion starts the ride, the monster also starts winding up for 0. 75 seconds, during which the player may issue a movement command in order to select the charge's starting direction. After finishing the wind-up, the monster begins charging in the chosen direction. The rider can steer the monster in the direction of their cursor. Enemies in the path of the charge are dealt 250 true damage , and knocked up and stunned them for 1 second. The charge stops at the end of the duration or when the monster collides with an enemy structure or terrain, causing it to lose 66% of its current health and forcing the champion to detach and emerge from its back at a distance of 200, increased to 700 if they charged into a targetable structure. The emerge distance increases by 75% of the champion's total attack range. The Mercenary starts its charge at 150 movement speed and ramps up non-linearly to a maximum of 600 over the first 5 seconds. This is increased by 75% while charging towards an enemy structure. If a starting direction for the charge is not chosen, the charge will default to the monster's facing direction. Hitting a targetable structure with the charge deals the same damage as if the Mercenary would charge into it herself, summons 5 (+ 1 − 6 (based on Touch of the Void stacks) ) Voidmites that attack the nearest structure, and grants the emerged champion a shield that decays over 4. 5 seconds. This effect cannot be used again until the Mercenary has assisted in destroying an enemy turret. The monster cannot be ridden if it is in combat with a structure. Runes [ ] Perfect Timing - Removed Removed from the game with the removal of Stopwatch . Replaced by Triple Tonic . Triple Tonic - New rune Replaces Perfect Timing . Inspiration Slot 1 rune. Passive: Gain an Elixir upon reaching each of the following levels: Level 3: Elixir of Avarice Level 6: Elixir of Force Level 9: Elixir of Skill Monsters [ ] Baron Nashor Model has been visually updated. Updated unit icon. Updated animations, visual effects, sound effects, tooltips and status icons. New Effect: Added an extended spawning animation that starts 20 seconds before spawning, during which he appears from the furthest point of the camp and wriggles under the bot-side river and toward his spawning location. New Effect - Corrupted Rift: Upon spawning for the first time, various terrain on the map becomes purple and fissured. In addition, newly-spawned or live non- Draconic Blue Sentinel , Red Brambleback , and Rift Scuttler monsters become permanently corrupted by the Void. Corrupted monsters gain increased durability and greatly improved effects when slain. The Blue Sentinel and Red Brambleback also lose their Draconic effects with the Corrupted monsters' respawn. New Effect: Now randomly spawns in one of three different forms: Hunting , Territorial , and All-Seeing . The Territorial and All-Seeing forms cause the terrain around the baron pit to permanently shift; the former adds a small wall in front of the pit, while the latter creates a long tunnel laterally. Each form also has a new ability that occurs 6 attacks after using his Acid Pool ability: Hunting Baron creates a pillar of lightning over all champions that strikes their location after 0. 7 seconds for the first target and every 0. 1 seconds thereafter for each next target. Each strike deals 15% of target's current health magic damage to champions hit, reduced by 50% for each subsequent hit in succession. Territorial Baron leans forward with his limbs over 0. 5 seconds, targeting the closest champion, then after 1 second pulls all enemies in a cone toward him over 0. 33 seconds for 300 units, dealing 75 magic damage to all champions pulled. All-Seeing Baron channels his eye to conjure a void rift toward the direction of the two furthest visible enemy champions within 2200 units. Each rift lasts for 3 seconds and deals 「 1000 magic damage over the duration. 」 「 150 magic damage for the first tick and 50 magic damage every 0. 166 seconds, over a total of 18 ticks. 」 Blue Sentinel New Effect: Upon becoming Draconic , killing the Blue Sentinel drops a Crest of Insight wisp at the location of the camp either for the player that has Smite equipped or, if the killer is the Smite user, at most one ally to pick up. The wisp lasts for 60 seconds. New Effect: After Baron Nashor spawns, all newly-spawned or live non- Draconic Blue Sentinel monsters become permanently corrupted by the Void, transforming into voidborn with 30% increased health and granting the Crest of Insight buff to the killer and all allies alive upon slaying it. The Blue Sentinel loses its Draconic effects with the Corrupted monster's respawn. Removed: No longer always drops a Crest of Insight wisp lasting for 60 seconds at the location of the camp when a player on the team has Primal Smite equipped. Red Brambleback New Effect: Upon becoming Draconic , killing the Red Brambleback also drops a Crest of Cinders wisp at the location of the camp either for the player that has Smite equipped or, if the killer is the Smite user, at most one ally to pick up. The wisp lasts for 60 seconds. New Effect: After Baron Nashor spawns, all newly-spawned or live non- Draconic Red Brambleback monsters become permanently corrupted by the Void, transforming into voidborn with 30% increased health and granting the Crest of Cinders buff to the killer and all allies alive upon slaying it.

This may only affect one enemy at a time. Rift Scuttler New Effect: After Baron Nashor spawns, all newly-spawned or live Rift Scuttler monsters become permanently corrupted by the Void, transforming into voidborn with 30% increased health. When slain, it releases an aura of void energy around itself over 1. 5 seconds, granting sight of the surrounding area as it travels and revealing enemies in its path. Enemy champions are revealed for 3 seconds, while non-champions are revealed for 12 seconds. The reveal duration refreshes if they remain in the area where the energy is still spreading. Revealed wards have their health reduced to 1. Once the energy has spread out completely, it continues to grant sight of the area for another 3 seconds. Voidgrub - New monster Spawns in the baron pit as the Voidgrub camp at 5 minutes. All Voidgrubs despawn at 13:45 game time, or 13:55 if in combat. The camp consists of three epic Voidgrubs . A group of 3 Voidgrubs can respawn once per game and each group has a shared respawn timer of 4 minutes that begins once all 3 has been slain; for a total of six in a given game. Killing a Voidgrub is displayed in the kill feed for the ally team. Killing the camp is announced to both teams and the killer(s) of each Voidgrub are simultaneously displayed in the kill feed for the enemy team. Epic Monster takedown rewards are distributed per spawn group killed, i.e. killing at least one of the first three spawned will award one epic monster takedown, and killing at least one of the second three spawned will award another epic monster takedown. Every 12 seconds in combat, each Voidgrub also spawns four lesser Voidmites . When a Voidgrub dies, the remaining ones gain a shield for 25% maximum health (+ 25% missing health) , decaying linearly over 10 seconds. Each Voidgrub killed grants a stack of the Touch of the Void buff to all team members. This buff is not visible on enemies' status bar. At 5 and 6 stacks of this buff, also grants the Hunger of the Void buff. Summoner's Rift [ ] The river has been slightly widened at each sidelane end. In the jungle, a wide wall in front of the Dragon and Baron pits has been created, alongside the edge of the river. The banana brush, which was previously along the river end of the thick midlane wall, has been relocated to this wall's end that is closest to the midlane, and slightly extended into the river. The Blue Sentinel wall has been split. In the top lane, the outer turret wall has been mirrored from blue onto red side. The blue side outer turret wall has been shrunk, creating more open area in the lane, and its long appendage into the jungle along the river has been shortened significantly. In the middle lane, the midlane entrance brushes have been pushed further back into the river, and the walls have been spread further apart as well. The thick midlane entrance wall has been split. The wall closest to the outer turret (opposite of the Raptor camp) has been significantly shrunk, leaving only a crescent. The thin midlane entrance wall is unchanged. In the bottom lane, the layout of the entire tri-bush area has been mirrored from blue side onto red side. The river brushes along the wall at the toplane (blue side) and botlane (red side) entrances have been removed in exchange for a single pixel brush in the middle of each sidelane's river entrance. Elemental Rift [ ] General New Effect: When Elemental Rift arrives, now causes all newly-spawned and live Red Brambleback and Blue Sentinel monsters to become Draconic until newly-spawned ones eventually transform to their Corrupted form. Draconic monsters gain improved effects when slain. Infernal Rift New Effect: Now spawns Infernal Cinders (or simply cinders ) around the map randomly and in small groups of 2–4 that last for 3 minutes, with a higher chance of spawning on the losing team's half of the map, based on team gold. Cinders can be picked up by champions by moving over them, granting 150% bonus movement speed decaying over 2 seconds and a stack of Infernal Cinder . For each stack, gain 0. 3 ability haste . Upon death, champions can hold up to 5 Infernal Cinder stacks without dropping them. If the champion killed had more than 5 Infernal Cinder stacks, 50% of their remaining cinders are dropped near the location of their death in a ring, which allows other champions to pick them up after 0. 85 seconds, while the rest of the stacks are lost. Dropped cinders last for 30 seconds before disappearing. The movement speed granted by picked-up cinders cannot stack; the duration of the buff only refreshes with each one obtained. For every 25 cinders collected, champions gain an increasingly bright glow. Removed: No longer burns up the patches of brush and sections of the walls surrounding the camps for the Blue Sentinel and Red Brambleback . Mountain Rift Removed: No longer forms a rock near the red-side Raptor camp . Ocean Rift Honeyfruit near the middle lane have been relocated to account for the nearby terrain changes. Removed: No longer has a puddle underneath each of the Honeyfruits near the middle lane. Turrets [ ] Inner turret health increased to 4000 from 3000. Inhibitor turret health increased to 3500 from 3300. Nexus turret health increased to 3000 from 2700. Backdoor damage reduction increased to 80% from 66. 666 %. Backdoor damage reduction now reduces true damage instead of nullifying it entirely. Neutral buffs [ ] Crest of Cinders Health regeneration reduced to 0. 5 / 1 / 3% (based on level) maximum health from 0. 5 / 1 / 3 / 5% (based on level) maximum health . Removed: If the buff was granted from a Corrupted Red Brambleback , it no longer transfers to the killer. Crest of Insight Ability haste changed to 10 at all levels from 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 (based on level) . Removed: If the buff was granted from a Corrupted Blue Sentinel , it no longer transfers to the killer. Hand of Baron Updated icon.
