He will reload over a few seconds immediately after expending all shells or withholding leftover shells for a while. The reload time is reduced by Graves' level and bonus attack speed , and can be interrupted by declaring an attack or casting an ability. Innate - 12-Gauge: Graves' basic attack sprays 4 pellets in a cone, each colliding with the first enemy unit or structure in their path, dealing 70% − 100. 01 % (based on level) AD physical damage plus 「 23. 31 % − 33. 3 % (based on level) AD damage 」 「 about one-third of the damage 」 for each subsequent pellet hitting the same target, up to 139. 93 % − 199. 92 % (based on level) AD physical damage against a single target. Pellets deal 25% reduced damage against structures . Critical strikes spray 6 pellets over a 25% wider cone, with each pellet dealing (30% + 16% ) bonus physical damage , resulting in 「 73. 3 % (+ 18. 66 %) bonus damage to attacks where all pellets hit. 」 「 242. 52 % − 346. 48 % (based on level) (+ 26. 12 % − 37. 31 % (based on level) ) AD physical damage if all pellets hit. 」 Pellets apply life steal at 100% effectiveness. Only the first pellet to hit each enemy applies on-hit effects . Innate - Buckshot: Non-champion units hit by more than one pellet are knocked back , though not through terrain. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro See Notes Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked Blocked Blocked The in-game HUD displays Graves' reload speed in place of his attack speed. This is a visual bug, and his attack speed behaves normally. His reload speed is in the form of reloads per second: Graves' bonus attack speed growth and the cap affect his reload speed, making his bonus attack speed more worth after each level. Reload speed: Scales less the more attack speed you have until 150% bonus attack speed (not included growth). Going over that will decrease the reload speed until capping at 200% bonus attack speed . The reload time after firing both shells and the time before the reloading starts while sitting on one shell are the same, of 2. 08 seconds. They're then reduced by bonus attack speed , to a minimum of 1. 54 − 1. 12 (based on level) seconds. Reload speed at 150% bonus attack speed: 0. 651 − 0. 891 (based on level) . The reload time with one shell is 1. 3 seconds. Graves' attack windup is based on such a low value that it will always take only 1 game tick , even at the lowest possible attack speed ( 0.2AS ). When Graves' has his range increased by 35% to 573. 75 via Rapid Firecannon , it has special effects on his cone spread: The reach of the individual missiles is also increased by 35% to 843. 75 / 783. 75 . The spread of the individual missiles is decreased by 35% ( angle  ×  1/1.35 ) to 17. 7 ° / 22. 2 ° . The reduced spread means that the empowered attack can deal adequate damage in a scaled-up cone. Given the right circumstances pellets can fly past and beyond the intended target without colliding with them, and thus collide with other enemies. Because the first pellet to hit an enemy deals unreduced damage, this can increase the total damage of the attack dealt, but spread across more targets instead. If Graves is blinded pellets will fly (still in a cone) in a random direction (excluding his target's) but he can still damage nearby enemy units hit by pellets. Structures will intercept and can be hit by multiple pellets , as with other valid targets. Wards and Jungle plants will not intercept pellets , and instead be triggered by a hiden homing attack missile (3000 missile speed, 3400 on crit), reminiscent of the more standard ranged attack of pre-rework Graves . Graves will not collaterally damage wards or jungle plants, and blocking pellets from reaching the target ward or jungle plant will not prevent Graves from damaging them. The first pellet to hit an enemy deals basic damage , additional ones to hit the same enemy from the same attack deal default damage . Because of this, only the first pellet to hit each enemy applies on-hit effects (see further details below). The additional pellets still apply life steal . Warden's Mail only reduces damage from the first pellet to hit its wearer. PENDING FOR TEST: Randuin's Omen's damage reduction to critical damage will apply to the damage of each pellet from a critical buckshot. Attack effects have a variety of interactions with New Destiny : On-hit effects are dealt to each stuck target, but not multiple times to the same target by subsequent pellets from the same attack. The order is based on the order in which the targets are hit. "Single-use" on-hit effects (e.g. Spellblade ) will be applied to the first enemy hit; the closest one. On-Action Effects such as Help, Pix! and Runaan's Hurricane will be triggered, and still obey their standard target-acquisition rules. Wind's Fury can select secondary targets that will also be damaged by collision from Graves' attack. Energized is special and will be applied by a hidden homing attack missile (3000 missile speed, 3400 on crit), reminiscent of the more standard ranged attack of pre-rework Graves . The effect is therefore guaranteed to affect his attack target. Black Cleaver triggers on every instance of physical damage , so it will apply 1 stack when each individual pellet hits, stacking multiple times if multiple pellets hit the same target (Armor reduction does not take effect until the automatic stat update).

Physical Damage: 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 (+ 80% bonus AD) After 2 seconds, or 0. 231 seconds upon colliding with terrain, the round detonates to deal physical damage to enemies within a wide perpendicular area and in a reverse wave along the powder trail. Physical Damage: 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 / 225 (+ 40 / 70 / 100 / 130 / 160% bonus AD) Total Physical Damage: 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 / 330 (+ 120 / 150 / 180 / 210 / 240% bonus AD) Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes See Notes Spell shields can only block one instance of the ability's damage. Wind Wall will destroy the projectile entirely and mitigate all effects, including the trail on the ground. Unbreakable is considered to be terrain for the purposes of the projectile, triggering its second effect. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Edit Smoke Screen Smoke Screen COST: 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90 Mana COOLDOWN: 26 / 24 / 22 / 20 / 18 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 950 EFFECT RADIUS: 200 SPEED: 1500 Sight Reduction: 250 Active: Graves fires a smoke canister at the target location that upon impact deals magic damage to enemies within the area and slows them by 50% for 0. 5 seconds. Magic Damage: 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 (+ 60% AP) The canister creates a cloud of smoke for 4 seconds that applies nearsight of outside the area to all enemies within every 0. 25 seconds, reducing their sight radius relative to the center. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Smoke Screen will nearsight untargetable units. Spell shields will block the instance of damage and slow , but will not mitigate the persistent area of effect. Crowd control immunity and cleanses have no effect on the user's sight radius reduction despite the nearsight being resisted / removed. Loss of allied vision will still be affected. Removing or resisting the nearsight will prevent it from being reapplied while staying inside the area (leaving and coming back inside will not). The nearsight debuff applies to non-champions but it does not inherently stop them from performing actions that require sight , such as basic attacking . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Edit Quickdraw Quickdraw COST: 40 Mana COOLDOWN: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 375 / 275 Active: Graves dashes to the target location, reloading one shell while generating a stack of True Grit for 4 seconds, stacking up to 8 times. Dashing towards an enemy champion generates 2 stacks of True Grit . Quickdraw's current cooldown is reduced by 0. 5 seconds for every pellet impacting an enemy. True Grit: For each stack, Graves gains bonus armor . Subsequent casts of Quickdraw and attacks versus non- minions will refresh the duration of True Grit . Bonus Armor: 2 / 5 / 8 / 11 / 14 Maximum Bonus Armor: 16 / 40 / 64 / 88 / 112 Quickdraw resets Graves' basic attack timer. If Graves dashes while reloading, he can cast any of his abilities during the dash. (bug) Quickdraw will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Counters Grounded Knockdown Disabled Interrupted Graves gains the one additional stack of True Grit from Quickdraw if at any point during the dash a visible enemy champion is in front of Graves within 1300 distance. Enemy champions have to be targetable to grant the additional stack. The additional stack of True Grit is gained when dashing towards clones just like actual champions. This check never happens if Graves dashes 0 distance (impossible outside of bugs), and will not always repeat a final time at the very end of the dash. Otherwise, it occurs continously while Graves is dashing. PENDING FOR TEST: Exact angle requirement. Edit Collateral Damage Collateral Damage COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 100 / 80 / 60 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 1100 / 1690 EFFECT RADIUS: 590 WIDTH: 200 ANGLE: 60° SPEED: 2100 Active: Graves fires an explosive shell in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit and causes him to recoil 300 units in the opposite direction. Physical Damage: 275 / 425 / 575 (+ 150% bonus AD) Upon hitting an enemy champion or reaching the end of its range, the shell explodes in a cone to deal 80% damage to additional enemies.

The projectile will still explode early if the champion hit by the shell is protected by a spell shield . The explosion cone is anchored on the location of the shell missile when it collided with a champion, or otherwise its maximum cast range. Collateral Damage is disabled while grounded but not while rooted . Graves will not dash after the cast time if he is airborne . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins.

The icon for Collateral Damage is a reference to explosive hazard safety signs. Graves' shotgun can be seen in the game's Mac version trailer . Graves was the product of playerbase requests for a 'manly' ranged carry.
