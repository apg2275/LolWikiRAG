Get Excited! Innate: Whenever Jinx scores a takedown against an enemy champion , epic monster , turret , or inhibitor within 3 seconds of damaging them, she gains 175% bonus movement speed decaying over 6 seconds. Additionally, she gains a stack of Get Excited! and is allowed to exceed the attack speed cap for the same duration. Only takedowns against enemy champions can grant stacks beyond the first. Each stack grants her 25% total attack speed , stacking up to 5 times for a maximum of 125% . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Jinx's attack speed cap is increased to 90. 0 for the duration, however this value is already beyond the technical limit for attack speed. Jinx will still trigger Get Excited from killing a summoned Rift Herald . Jinx will fail to trigger Get Excited in the specific circumstance of killing Baron Nashor while more than ~2500 distance away. (bug) Edit Switcheroo! Switcheroo! COST: 20 Mana per attack with Fishbones CAST TIME: none STATIC COOLDOWN: 0. 9 EFFECT RADIUS: 250 Toggle: Jinx switches between Pow-Pow , her minigun, and Fishbones , her rocket launcher. Pow-Pow: Basic attacks with Pow-Pow generate a stack of Rev'd up for 2. 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks with Pow-Pow and stacking up to 3 times. Each stack of Rev'd up grants bonus attack speed , with all stacks beyond the first one being 50% effective. Stacks expire by one when the duration ends. Bonus Attack Speed: 15 / 27. 5 / 40 / 52. 5 / 65% Attack Speed per Subsequent Stack: 7. 5 / 13. 75 / 20 / 26. 25 / 32. 5 % Maximum Attack Speed: 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130% Fishbones: Basic attacks with Fishbones cost mana on-attack to deal 110% AD modified physical damage to the target and nearby enemies. The damage is affected by critical strike modifiers. While Fishbones is equipped, Jinx gains bonus range but loses 10% of her bonus attack speed . Bonus Range: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 Only the first attack after switching to Fishbones will benefit from Rev'd up . Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked Toggle abilities do not count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Jinx's first attack after switching to Fishbones can be triggered after 0. 4 seconds, instead of using the attack timer. Despite Jinx starting the game using Pow-Pow she doesn't receive any bonus attack speed until Switcheroo! has been learned. Fishbones splash damage affects structures (minions will target Jinx ) but does not affect targets if Jinx's attacks are blocked , dodged , or missed . With Runaan's Hurricane Pow-Pow generates one stack per enemy hit. Each of Runaan's Hurricane's additional bolts apply Fishbones' splash damage, which stacks with each other. Both weapons deal basic damage to their primary target (this includes the increased damage of Fishbones ), which applies life steal based on the damage dealt (post-mitigation) as usual. The splash damage of Fishbones is based on the pre-mitigation damage done to the primary target (which includes critical strikes), and is not considered modified physical damage . It deals default damage : It doesn't apply life steal or on-hit effects . Fishbones damage: 110% AD (100% + 10%). Fishbones critical strike damage: 192. 5 % AD ((100% + 10%) × 1. 75 ). Fishbones critical strike damage with Infinity Edge : 231% AD ((100% + 10%) × 2. 1 ). Fishbones bolt damage: 44% AD ((100% + 10%) × 0. 4 ). Fishbones bolt critical strike damage: 77% AD ((100% + 10%) × 0. 4 × 1. 75 ). Fishbones bolt critical strike damage with Infinity Edge : 92. 4 % AD ((100% + 10%) × 0. 4 × 2. 1 ). Fishbones potential damage on stacked enemies with Runaan's Hurricane : 198% AD (110% + 44% + 44%). Fishbones potential critical strike damage on stacked enemies with Runaan's Hurricane : 346. 5 % AD ((110% + 44% + 44%) × 1. 75 ). Fishbones potential critical strike damage on stacked enemies with Runaan's Hurricane and Infinity Edge : 415. 8 % AD ((110% + 44% + 44%) × 2. 1 ). Edit Zap! Zap!

Magic Damage: 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270 (+ 100% AP) Each Chomper explodes on contact with an enemy champion , knocking them down and rooting them for 1. 5 seconds. Enemy champions can be affected by only one Chomper . Flame Chompers! will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes See Notes Chompers will halt when encountering Wind Wall and Unbreakable .

The explosion deals physical damage to nearby enemies and grants sight of the area for 2 seconds. Super Mega Death Rocket! deals 10% − 100% (based on distance traveled) damage. This does not affect the bonus damage based on the target's missing health . Maximum Physical Damage: 325 / 475 / 625 (+ 165% bonus AD) (+ 25 / 30 / 35% of target's missing health) Minimum Physical Damage: 32. 5 / 47. 5 / 62. 5 (+ 16. 5 % bonus AD) (+ 25 / 30 / 35% of target's missing health) Enemies surrounding the primary target take 80% damage.

Hide Details Tips & Tricks Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Spell shield will not prevent the explosion. Super Mega Death Rocket's projectile has an icon on the mini-map while it is in flight. It can be seen by only Jinx and her allies. The bonus damage based on missing health is based on each unit's own missing health and not the primary target's. Unlike similar spells, Super Mega Death Rocket will not increase it's damage when ranked up while the missile is in flight. (bug) This is because the base damage is fixed at a multiple of the damage the rocket initially started with. The bonus AD ratio will still update when AD is gained or lost between the cast and hit of the missile. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Tips & Tricks The maximum damage is reached after traveling 1500 units, which is equal to roughly 0. 85 seconds of travel time. The rocket changes its visual appearance and missile speed slightly earlier, after traveling 1350 units. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 50 / 40 / 30 seconds.

Original View in 3D 880 09.10.2013 A manic and impulsive criminal from Zaun, Jinx lives to wreak havoc without care for the consequences. With an arsenal of deadly weapons, she unleashes the loudest blasts and brightest explosions to leave a trail of mayhem and panic in her wake. Jinx despises boredom, and gleefully brings her own chaotic brand of pandemonium wherever she goes. Sarah Anne Williams Katie 'TeaTime' De Sousa Loot eligible Crime City View in 3D 975 09.10.2013 Known by state police as “La Principessa,” Jinx is an unhinged hitwoman with loose ties to the Graves crime family. Sent into rival businesses as a figurative time bomb, the slightest offense will trigger one of her jubilant rampages, with body counts as high as the ceiling. Sarah Anne Williams Michelle Hoefener Crime City Loot eligible Additional/unique quotes New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Firecracker View in 3D 1350 10.02.2015 Never one to turn down an imaginary challenge, Jinx has constructed a number of Lunar Revel weapons, including a seven foot long rocket shaped like an angry dragon. She'll tell you it's a fun firecracker for parties. It is not.

No laws, no civilization, not even a thin veneer of polite society had survived—just a numberless horde of slime-vomiting bullet sponges and all the ammo she can forage. It's paradise. Sarah Anne Williams Christian Fell Zombies VS Slayers Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Star Guardian View in 3D 1820 05.10.2016 Much to the annoyance of her team, Jinx is an impulsive and sometimes cynical Star Guardian who loves a good, glittery explosion.

Sarah Anne Williams Jem Flores Snowdown Showdown Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Odyssey View in 3D 1350 12.09.2018 Adept at building and/or destroying (but mostly destroying) a variety of haphazard, highly unstable weaponry for the Morning Star crew, Jinx also serves as the ship's pilot. Her previous job as a mining explosives technician resulted in a lot of collateral damage, and a thoroughly justified dismissal. Sarah Anne Williams Esben Lash Rasmussen Odyssey Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Odyssey Jinx Chromas Aquamarine Emerald Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Tanzanite PROJECT View in 3D 1350 01.08.2019 Jinx volunteered for PROJECT conversion, never expecting that a critical power failure would scramble her memory core, leaving her a psychopath driven by the manic voices in her head. Seemingly obsessed with destruction for its own sake, she has begun to show signs of something far more sinister than mere memory fragmentation: the cold, calculating influence of Program.

She's not really a soldier, doesn't seem to care about humanity's cause, and doesn't follow orders -- but there's no arguing with Jinx's results.

[2] In-universe, Jinx's alias was given to her by Vi . Jinx's dance is a reference to Jake's dance from Adventure Time . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Super Mega Death Rocket!'s blast radius displays a smiley face upon impact. Get Excited! also displays a smiley face over Jinx upon activation. Jinx is the first champion whose laugh animation automatically loops. Jinx's hair (or scarf on Crime City Jinx ) forms a heart when she dies. Jinx is the only champion to have all her ability names end in an exclamation mark. Whenever Jinx is on the opposing team, Vi and/or Caitlyn each gain the Catch me if you can! cosmetic debuff. On 21 August 2018, women have statistically attributed Jinx as "The most visually appealing champion in League". [3] Jinx is the third champion to have one skin for each of the three big annual events of the year - Lunar Revel , Harrowing and Snowdown Showdown . The skin that gave her this distinction was Ambitious Elf Jinx in 2017. The first two were Katarina and Nidalee with their Warring Kingdoms skins in 2015. Annie almost became another champion that fulfilled the criteria after Panda Annie was released in 2013. However, Frostfire Annie was not released during the Snowdown Showdown event. Jinx - Vi is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being Cassiopeia - Katarina , Kayle - Morgana , Nasus - Renekton , Garen - Lux , Yasuo - Yone , and Darius - Draven ). Though not a pair, Anivia , Ornn , and Volibear are also siblings.
