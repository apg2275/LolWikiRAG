For the removed enchantment, see Enchantment: Homeguard . Homestart and Homeguard are passive effects that increase the champion's movement speed while on the spawn in Summoner's Rift . Homestart [ ] At the beginning of the game, Homestart is granted to all champions on both teams. Homestart grants 175% bonus movement speed for 15 seconds. Completing a Teleport channel or receiving damage or dealing damage will remove the effect immediately. The bonus also decays over 0. 75 seconds after crossing the outer turret line. For the first 55 seconds of the game, Homestart will refresh its duration as long as the champion stays in the fountain. If the champion leaves the fountain, they are prevented from gaining Homestart ever again. Homeguard [ ] Champions can gain Homeguard on differing conditions based on game time. Damage dealt to enemies further away than 5000 units will not remove Homeguard . Respawn Homeguard [ ] Before 14:00 , Homeguard is granted to every champion whenever they respawn, regardless of if they were killed by an enemy champion or executed . Homeguard grants 66. 67 % bonus movement speed that decays over 5 seconds. Completing a Teleport channel or receiving damage or dealing damage will remove the effect immediately. This effect is not granted if the champion dealt or received damage within the last 8 seconds. Homeguard will refresh its duration as long as the champion stays in the fountain. Leaving the fountain will prevent the buff from refreshing. Spawn Homeguard [ ] After 14:00 , an empowered Homeguard is granted to all champions in their respective spawn. This empowered Homeguard restores 12% of missing health and 12% of missing mana every 0. 5 seconds while at the spawn and grants 75% − 150% (based on minutes) bonus movement speed that decays over 7 seconds. Champions with the Hand of Baron buff have this bonus further increased to 125% − 200% (based on minutes) . Completing a Teleport channel will remove the effect. Receiving or dealing damage will remove all effects and prevent the champion from gaining them again for 8 seconds. Completing a Recall channel resets this timer. This version of Homeguard will have its duration refreshed whenever the champion is in the spawn, and can be regained even after leaving the spawn. Notes [ ] Kayn also gains a non-refreshing Homeguard upon completing one of his transformations , which can occur on any map and at any time. He can only gain this Homeguard after 14 minutes on Summoner's Rift , while on other maps it is given to him regardless of game time. Homeguard activates upon entering/spawning on the starting platform. Standing on the outer edge of the spawn's circle will not grant the buff; champions must stand on the center of the platform where they are positioned after spawning or recalling. Strategy [ ] Homeguard dramatically reduces the time needed to fully regenerate at the fountain, making it effective at outlasting enemies sieging the entrance of your base. Trivia [ ] Homestart and Homeguard will trigger move-fast animations where available, and can often be the only time such animations are seen in a given game. When unavailable, the champion's standard movement animation will be used but at incredible speed, such is the case for Nautilus , Pantheon , Vayne , and Zac . Some champions and skins feature animations exclusive to Homestart and Homeguard , and cannot be trigger elsewhere even if similar speeds are reached - e.g. Heimerdinger , PROJECT: Vayne and Pool Party Rek'Sai . This is often due to the animations not being designed to blend into general gameplay. Patch History [ ] V13.10 Homeguard timer reduced to 14:00 from 20:00. Homeguard bonus movement speed changed to 75% − 150% (based on minutes) from 75% − 150% (based on minutes) .

Unknown patch Undocumented: Early game death Homeguards are once again granted to players respawning after having been executed. (bug) V11.6 Homeguard is now removed when completing a Teleport channel. V10.11 When a player is executed by a neutral damage source (minions, monsters, turrets, etc.), they will no longer get the early game death Homeguards. V10.8 On Summoner's Rift, until 20 minutes, gain 66. 67 % bonus movement speed that decays over 5 seconds upon respawning. V8.8 Homestart is granted by the fountain up to 55 seconds into the game from 35. Removed: Homestart buff no longer falls off instantly after crossing the river line.

V5.23 New Effect: Starting from 20 minutes, all champions now receive the Homeguard buff whenever they visit the fountain. Grants 175% bonus movement speed that decays over 8 seconds. While in the fountain, restores 12% of missing health and 12% of missing mana per fountain healing tick. Receiving or dealing damage will remove all effects and prevent you from gaining them again for 8 seconds. Damage dealt to enemies further away than 5000 units will not disable Homeguard .
