Edit Black Shield Black Shield COST: 80 mana COOLDOWN: 26 / 23. 5 / 21 / 18. 5 / 16 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 800 Active: Morgana grants a shield to the target allied champion or herself for 5 seconds, which absorbs incoming magic damage and grants crowd control immunity while it holds. Magic Shield Strength: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 70% AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Black Shield will not resist self nor allied crowd control . Black Shield will not resist nearsight . Black Shield negates crowd control effects before any magic damage is absorbed, even if the shield is broken by an enemy's ability its associated disables will not apply, except for shield-destroying effects such as Ruthless Predator and Static Field . Black Shield will not prevent any other effect other than crowd control unless absolutely necessary. As such, an ability that has two different mechanics like Nether Grasp will not suppress a target protected by Black Shield but the tether still applies. Although not considered a crowd control effect, Black Shield may also block Illaoi's Test of Spirit's spirit pull. Black Shield takes precedence over other sources of crowd control immunity and those that grant immunity to specific types of crowd control ( displacement immunity and slow immunity ). Spell shield will take priority over Black Shield . Black Shield will always take priority over regular shields . If used in conjunction with Lifeline , the most recently-applied one will do so however. Black Shield will not negate self or ally applied crowd control effects such as an allied Bard's Tempered Fate .

Stun Duration: 1. 5 / 1. 75 / 2 A nearby enemy champion is required to cast this ability. The target does not have to be visible to be tethered by this ability. Link ▶️ "I will take on everything!"

Original View in 3D 585 21.02.2009 Conflicted between her celestial and mortal natures, Morgana bound her wings to embrace humanity, and inflicts her pain and bitterness upon the dishonest and the corrupt.
