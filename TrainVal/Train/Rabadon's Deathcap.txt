Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Ability power changed to 80. Strategy Rabadon's Deathcap is most suited for champions that have effects that scale with ability power (such as abilities, items, and runes), especially those with higher ratios. Rabadon's Deathcap is best purchased after having acquired a high amount of ability power. This is because the item does not provide anything other than ability power in contrast to other items which provide unique bonus effects. Those items may scale with and also grant ability power, thus Rabadon's Deathcap becomes more valuable as it will make those items even more effective due to its large increase in the stat. Given a situation where the user can purchase Rabadon's Deathcap or Void Staff , the choice between the two is highly dependent on the champion's ratios. Rabadon's Deathcap becomes a better purchase if the user would gain more damage from the large increase in ability power due to having high ability power ratios. Otherwise, Void Staff is more optimal of a purchase as its passive will increase overall magic damage dealt in spite of ability power ratios. Old icons 1st version 2nd version 1st version (Rabadon's Deathcrown) Trivia This item resulted from a separation of the offensive and defensive abilities of Zhonya's Ring . This is the offensive item, while Zhonya's Hourglass is its defensive counterpart. It was originally named Banksy's Deathcap in the Patch Day Preview. This is a tribute to David 'Banksy' Banks, a Riot Games Inc. Director of Platform Engineering. The image artwork would seem to be based on the Sorting Hat from the Harry Potter franchise. There are eyes and a mouth-like band visible on the hat, very similar to the Sorting Hat. Not counting other ability power items or runes , Rabadon's Deathcap gives 189 ability power alone. The upgrade from its parts grants 49 AP. While it has the potential to be the single highest source of ability power in the game, Rabadon's Deathcap is rarely purchased first, as its passive ability requires other ability power items to be fully effective, to the point of the item being barely cost effective, which the large majority of expensive items are by a large margin. It is also somewhat difficult to build early in the game as both of its components are quite expensive, making it difficult to purchase without kills or other gold income.
