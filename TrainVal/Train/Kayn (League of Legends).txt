He gathers orbs from champion takedowns and each instance of damage (excluding damage over time ) dealt against champions. Once he has earned enough orbs, he unlocks a form based on whether he earned more from melee or ranged champions (for Darkin and Shadow Assassin , respectively), with the other form unlocked later. Kayn can move near the summoning platform to transform over 6 seconds, restoring to full health and mana and becoming invulnerable , untargetable , and unable to act for the duration. Kayn cannot choose a form if he is unable to cast abilities. The transformation will grant a passive bonus and permanently empower some of Kayn's abilities based on the form chosen. He gains a one-time Homeguard once the transformation is complete. Shadow Assassin Bonus: If Kayn has been out of combat with enemy champions for over 8 seconds, or he casts Umbral Trespass , he deals 15% − 45% (based on level) of post-mitigation damage dealt against enemy champions as bonus magic damage , lasting for 3 seconds upon entering combat and also applying on the first instance of damage dealt. If this effect is ready, it will not be lost by taking damage. Darkin Bonus: Rhaast heals for 25% of the post-mitigation physical damage that he deals to enemy champions with his abilities . Link ▶️ Link ▶️ Transformation alert. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Entering transformation will not destroy in-flight projectiles . The Orb System The experience is depicted as orbs that drop upon the ground. Melee champions drop red orbs that grant progress towards Darkin , while ranged champions drop blue orbs that grant progress for Shadow Assassin . Orbs will remain on the ground until automatically collected by Kayn regardless of range once he leaves combat . The orbs will be collected even if Kayn dies . The experience bar above his portrait gauges his current progression, the color reflects the form with greater progress. Kayn can transform by interacting with his portrait, and can wait 4 minutes until the other form becomes available, reduced by 5 seconds for each collected orb of their type after that. Melee orbs grant 2 points per hit and 6 points per takedown. Ranged orbs grant 3 points per hit and 7 points per takedown. The amount of points received per orb is multiplied by 3 − 10. 39 (based on minutes) . The bar gets filled up completely at 500 points. If the two forms are within 8% of each other, the last champion range type hit will determine the winner. If both types are hit at the same time, the trasformation will default to Darkin . Each side's bar has a bucket system, starting at 60 points. Each time an orb is taken the system checks if there's an amount of points in the bucket equal to or higher than the amount received from the orb. If there is, Kayn is given an additional orb of the same type he received, while also subtracting that amount of points from the bucket. The bucket fills by 0. 8 points per second if out of champion combat for 70 seconds. Damage dealt by damage over time effects and specifically First Strike and Summon Aery will not grant orbs. Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit Transformation no longer restores full health and mana . Arena differences edit New Effect: Gains 30 Orbs per round. Shadow Assassin bonus damage changed to 30% − 60% (based on level) . Shadow Assassin bonus damage cooldown changed to 4 seconds. Edit Reaping Slash Reaping Slash COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 7 / 6. 5 / 6 / 5. 5 / 5 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 350 Active: Kayn dashes in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies he passes through. He then swings his scythe, dealing the same damage to nearby enemies. Physical Damage: 75 / 95 / 115 / 135 / 155 (+ 80% bonus AD) Total Physical Damage: 150 / 190 / 230 / 270 / 310 (+ 160% bonus AD) Both instances of Reaping Slash deal 40 bonus physical damage against minions and monsters . Non-Champion Damage: 115 / 135 / 155 / 175 / 195 (+ 80% bonus AD) Total Non-Champion Damage: 230 / 270 / 310 / 350 / 390 (+ 160% bonus AD) Darkin Bonus: Reaping Slash's damage is modified to deal 65% AD (+ 5% (+ 3. 5 % per 100 bonus AD) of the target's maximum health) physical damage for both instances. This damage has a cap against monsters that does not include the bonus damage. Capped Monster Damage per Hit: 200 / 250 / 300 / 350 / 400 Total Capped Monster Damage: 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 / 800 Reaping Slash's dash speed scales with Kayn's total movement speed . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown See Notes Disabled Interrupted Spell shields will block only a single instance of damage - either the dash or the slash. If the dash is interrupted , Kayn will not swing his scythe. Reaping Slash's swing can be performed quicker if the dash stops prematurely upon colliding with terrain. As the Shadow Assassin , an alternate icon for Reaping Slash is used but has no modified effect. Other abilities can be queued while casting Reaping Slash . All item actives can be used during Reaping Slash . Zhonya's Hourglass will not stop the dash or the damage from occurring. Using an item active that has a dash, such as Hextech Rocketbelt , will override Reaping Slash's dash if used before it ends, preventing the slash from happening. If used after Reaping Slash's dash ends, Kayn can reposition where the slash happens. The swing's animation has a 0. 25 -second lockout time. Kayn will only be able to move after 0. 416 seconds. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Darkin health ratio changed to 4% of target's maximum health . Darkin bonus AD ratio changed to 3% per 100 bonus AD . Edit Blade's Reach Blade's Reach COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 CAST TIME: 0. 55 / None TARGET RANGE: 700 / 900 Active: Kayn swings his scythe in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies hit and slowing them by 90% decaying over 1. 5 seconds. Physical Damage: 90 / 135 / 180 / 225 / 270 (+ 110% bonus AD) Shadow Assassin Bonus: Blade's Reach's radius is extended by 200 units. Kayn conjures an untargetable shadow at the casting position to perform Blade's Reach's sweep over 0. 55 seconds in his stead, removing the ability's cast time. Darkin Bonus: Blade's Reach knocks up enemies hit for 1 second. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked The hitbox of this ability is determined based on Kayn's position on-cast. Blade's Reach's indicator is visible to enemies while cast inside terrain and towards enemy champions. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.

If he has been in combat with enemy champions within the last 3 seconds, Shadow Step will instead last 1. 5 seconds. Duration: 7 / 7. 5 / 8 / 8. 5 / 9 Kayn heals himself upon entering terrain for the first time from casting Shadow Step and he gains unobstructed vision while inside. Heal: 90 / 100 / 110 / 120 / 130 (+ 45% bonus AD) Receiving damage from or dealing damage to an enemy champion while Shadow Step is active reduces its remaining duration to 1. 5 seconds. This effect also cannot remain active out of terrain for longer than 1. 5 seconds and will cancel immediately if Kayn performs a basic attack or becomes immobilized , excluding from sleep (bug) , or polymorphed . Shadow Assassin Bonus: Shadow Step's cooldown is reduced to 10 seconds at all ranks. Kayn gains 100% slow resist while active and, upon entering terrain, the bonus total movement speed is increased to 70% for the remaining duration. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Counters Grounded Disabled As Rhaast , an alternate icon for Shadow Step is used but has no modified effect. The bonus movement speed stacks multiplicatively with other sources of movement speed boosts. Self immobilizations such as Zhonya's Hourglass also count for interrupting Shadow Step . Recall is disabled while Kayn is inside terrain. Enemies cannot see Kayn while he is inside of terrain unless they have terrain-piercing vision, such as Heightened Senses , Hawkshot or unobstructed vision . However, enemies and allies (including Kayn ) will be notified when nearby terrain is infested if Kayn is within 1000 units of an enemy champion - with an indicator being placed on the terrain with a direct line between Kayn and the enemy champion. Slightly less than standard sight radius, but more than the camouflage detection radius. Kayn can move up to 550 units beyond the outer-edge of the battlefield. Shadow Step can interact with player-generated terrain . If Kayn is inside terrain when the effect ends, he will be placed correspondingly to the nearest valid space. Sleep will not interrupt Shadow Step . (bug) Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Shadow Assassin bonus movement speed changed to 100%. Shadow Assassin modified cooldown changed to 7 seconds. Edit Umbral Trespass Umbral Trespass COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 550 / 750 EFFECT RADIUS: 300 / 500 Passive: Kayn marks enemy champions he damaged in the last 3. 15 seconds. Active: Kayn vanishes and dashes to a marked enemy champion. Upon arrival, he channels for up to 2. 5 seconds, attaching to the target and revealing them. Umbral Trespass can be recast after 0. 75 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically after the duration or if it is interrupted . Recast: After a 0. 75 -second delay, Kayn deals physical damage to the target and dashes out from their body in the target direction, detaching himself from them and becoming targetable again at the end of the dash. Physical Damage: 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 175% bonus AD) Shadow Assassin Bonus: Umbral Trespass gains 200 bonus cast range and emerge range. Additionally, emerging will reset The Darkin Scythe's cooldown . Darkin Bonus: Umbral Trespass is modified to deal physical damage equal to 15% (+ 10% per 100 bonus AD) of the target's maximum health , and heals him for 9. 75 % (+ 6. 5 % per 100 bonus AD) of the target's maximum health . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit / Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown See Notes Disabled Not Interrupted Disruption See Notes The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade . Detonating the ability manually does not. The ability activation happens when Kayn is attached to his target and the channel starts. Kassadin cannot gain a stack for Force Pulse because Kayn is untargetable during the activation. The ability will recast if Kayn is ordered a movement command. The amount of time it takes for Kayn to attach to his target is between 0. 5 seconds (cast from max range, not as Shadow Assassin ) and 0. 25 seconds (cast from point blank range). This duration is fixed, meaning Kayn will attach regardless of how far away the target gets while he is dashing toward them. If the target dies , enters resurrection , or is sent to the Realm of Death while Kayn is attached , he will instantly detach and reappear on top of the target's location. This does not occur if Kayn is in the process of emerging from the target. If those same conditions occur before the attachment, Kayn will reappear at the target's location after completing the dash. In both of these cases, Umbral Trespass will occasionally not go on cooldown. (bug) Kayn will automatically emerge when attached to a clone that expires. If Kayn dies while attached and the recast is available, Umbral Trespass' damage is dealt immediately. If the recast is not available, Umbral Trespass' damage is not dealt at all. Entering resurrection while attached does not deal Umbral Trespass' damage regardless of if the recast is available or not. Kayn will detach immediately in both cases. During Umbral Trespass , Kayn will not take the self-inflicted damage from Death's Dance's Ignore Pain if the damage was sourced from a turret . As Rhaast , Umbral Trespass will grant the heal automatically if the target dies during the channel. The heal is not granted if the target dies before the channel starts. Umbral Trespass' interactions with crowd control : Being stunned or silenced or falling asleep while attached will cause the ability to recast automatically (even during the 0. 75 -second delay before Kayn is able to recast after attaching). Umbral Trespass cleanses Kayn from drowsiness . Kayn is immune to fear during Umbral Trespass . Roots will not prevent Kayn from initiating the recast. Displacements cannot interrupt the initial dash and neither can they apply while Kayn is attached. If the airborne source applies a debuff , Kayn attaches to his target immediately, ending the dash prematurely in the process. The debuff is also removed instantly. Until the recast or after the duration, the ability will have had no effect on the target for the purposes of Electrocute or the 'in-combat' status. Spell shields will prevent Kayn from infesting the target, but will do nothing to mitigate the recast when used once he has already infested them. If Kayn targets an enemy that is currently being protected by a spell shield , the ability will simply go on cooldown without making him infest his target. This is also true for Fiora's Riposte . Umbral Trespass cannot be cast on targetable zombie states such as Sion during Glory in Death . Kayn will draw turret aggro after the recast's dash, despite the damage occurring while he was untargetable. The damage is not blocked if the target becomes untargetable . Kayn will copy his target's total size for Umbral Trespass' duration, even if their size is smaller than his. The screen will direct to the target's position upon attaching. As Rhaast , an alternate icon is used for the initial activation of Umbral Trespass. The following table refers for interactions while Kayn is channeling and dashing out of the victim: The dash out is not interrupted by cast-inhibiting crowd control .

Original View in 3D 975 11.07.2017 A peerless practitioner of lethal shadow magic, Shieda Kayn battles to achieve his true destiny—to one day lead the Order of Shadow into a new era of Ionian supremacy. He wields the sentient darkin weapon Rhaast, undeterred by its creeping corruption of his body and mind. There are only two possible outcomes: either Kayn bends the weapon to his will… or the malevolent blade consumes him completely, paving the way for the destruction of all Runeterra.

The two war within Kayn's own body, each determined to overthrow the other and lay claim to true divinity.

It was then that the Snow Moon assassins struck. Stolen away from that temple into theirs, Kayn was inducted into the Snow Moon Order, their ancient ways piercing and unfamiliar. Only time will tell if their taming of his spirit holds.

Though he's got all the training of a pop music prince, his bad reputation after the breakup of his last band made him an industry pariah. Determined to spite the haters, Kayn joined HEARTSTEEL only to find creative partners (and friends?) he might actually trust.

He is the seventh dark-themed Ionian- affiliated champion (albeit Noxian- born ), after Shen , Varus , Syndra , Zed , Xayah & Jhin ; as well as the second-known member from the Order of Shadow. His given name Shieda is pronounced /ˈʃi:da/, and is Ionian in origin. [4] By coincidence, his surname Kayn resembles: Biblical Cain , from Semitic root q-y-n "smith" [5] < "spear" < " reed " *qanay . [6] Irish surname Kane , Anglicized from Gaelic Ó Catháin , from Proto-Celtic *katus "fight, battle". [7] His stint as a child-soldier references conscription of children ; Not all Noxian commanders condone their colleagues' callousness, though they at least turn a blind eye. While in Darkin form, the champion's ability tooltips change to read "Rhaast" instead of "Kayn". His dance references the Reebok dance . If you are tied in orbs for The Darkin Scythe , you will be defaulted to Rhaast . [8] Although patch V7.16 made it so the portrait of the selected skin would be used in the central portion of the in-game UI, transforming into Shadow Assassin or Rhaast always uses their base portraits for all skins. (Not true since V13.23) The Darkin Scythe's icons upon transformation for Shadow Assassin and Darkin are both reused for the Teamfight Tactics items Kayn's Liberation and Rhaast's Embrace respectively, which reference him and Rhaast.
