His pose from his very first splash art was reused for the first splash art for his Highland skin. King Tryndamere This skin shares the Medieval theme with: Blacksmith Poppy Little Knight Amumu Medieval Twitch Queen Ashe Sir Kled Sorceress Lux White Mage Veigar This skin represents the potential aftermath of the Freljord Civil War in which the Avarosan win and unite the tribes, with Tryndamere becoming the king and Ashe the queen. This also represents his appearance in his old lore. Highland Tryndamere This skin shares the Legacy theme with: Darkflame Shyvana Defender Leona Earthrune Skarner Gladiator Draven Hillbilly Gragas ...and others Iron Solari Leona Ironscale Shyvana Jailbreak Graves Rusty Blitzcrank Silverfang Akali This skin is a reference to the Highlander franchise. "Highland" is also an old term referring to people from the Scottish Highlands. So, the skin may rather be a reference to the old Scottish warrior garb than to the previously mentioned franchise. Attendees of the Season One Championship at Dreamhack qualified for a code to unlock Viking Tryndamere . This skin later became available on 24 June 2011 for 975 RP . Viking Tryndamere This skin shares the Wonders of the World theme with: Bear Cavalry Sejuani Dynasty Ahri Masked Shaco Oktoberfest Gragas Outback Renekton ...and others Panda Teemo Sultan Tryndamere Uncle Ryze Vizier Malzahar Winged Hussar Xin Zhao This skin is a reference to the Vikings , An ancient Norse group of seafarers of Scandinavia . Demonblade Tryndamere This skin shares the Otherroads theme with: Acolyte Lee Sin Divine Soraka Foreseen Yasuo Noxus Poppy Prototype Viktor ...and others Redeemed Riven Rune Wars Renekton Runeguard Volibear Transcended Kayle Tyrant Swain This skin is an allusion to Aatrox's old quote "Tryndamere, my greatest creation" while also being evocative of the Darkin himself. In Wild Rift the skin was updated to have visuals of Tryndamere being consumed by a Darkin weapon similar to Kayn . His trailer can be seen here . This skin is possibly a reference to Nightmare from the Soul Calibur series. This skin also resembles Haru Glory from the Rave Master series. One of Haru's swords claims the wielder's soul in exchange for greatly increased strength. During the process, the sword will fuse to the wielder's arm. Tryndamere was the first champion to have a non-comical Legendary skin voice-over. He features in the A Twist of Fate cinematic . Despite being legendary tier in League of Legends , the skin is only epic tier in Wild Rift . Sultan Tryndamere This skin shares the Wonders of the World theme with: Bear Cavalry Sejuani Dynasty Ahri Masked Shaco Oktoberfest Gragas Outback Renekton ...and others Panda Teemo Uncle Ryze Viking Tryndamere Vizier Malzahar Winged Hussar Xin Zhao He was released in celebration of the Turkish Server 's launch. His clothing and the scene depicted in the splash art make him resemble an Ottoman sultan, specifically Mehmed the Conqueror . The Turkish client has a unique voiceover by actor Cihan Ãœnal.

Dragonblade Riven She represented the path of freedom . He references a famous historical Chinese general Guan Yu from the late Eastern Han era , whose military exploits Luo Guanzhong depicted prominently in Romance of the Three Kingdoms . Coincidentally, Guan Yu is a playable character in the MOBA Smite, together with the original Sun Wukong. Both also feature in Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi series. In this skin, Tryndamere's sword-blade resembles that of the Azure Dragon Crescent Glaive , anachronistically associated with Guan Yu, despite that the weapon is a polearm and originates hardly before the Song dynasty in reality.
