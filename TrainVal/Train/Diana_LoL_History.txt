Lunar Rush consumes Moonlight on-hit. If Lunar Rush is interrupted, the target's Moonlight will still be consumed and the cooldown reset. Pending for test : If Lunar Rush is spell shielded the Moonlight debuff is still consumed and therefore Lunar Rush's cooldown is still reset. Tips & Tricks Since abilities can be used during the dash, it is possible for a Crescent Strike cast during Lunar Rush to mark the target before Lunar Rush hits them, thus resetting the cooldown.
