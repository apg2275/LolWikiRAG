Angle: 80 °. Cast Time: 0. 5 − 0. 19 (based on bonus attack speed) seconds. Static Cooldown: 16 − 6 (based on bonus attack speed) seconds. Soul Unbound (E) Yone dashes a fixed distance in the target direction, gaining Spirit Form for 5 seconds as well as creating an untargetable clone a short distance behind the cast location, though not sending it through terrain. After a 0. 5 -second delay, Yone can recast Soul Unbound . Spirit Form: Yone's resets Way of the Hunter's state, gains 10% − 30% (based on time active) bonus movement speed and marks champions damaged with basic attacks or abilities. Each mark stores 25 / 27. 5 / 30 / 32. 5 / 35% of the post-mitigation physical damage and magic damage that Yone deals to them with his basic attacks and abilities. Recast: Yone becomes displacement immune and, after the cast time, dashes back to his body, detonates the marks of each champion to deal true damage equal to the stored amount against them, and cleanses himself from all crowd control effects except disarm , ground , nearsight , silence , and slow .
