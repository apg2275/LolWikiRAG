Malphite will gain the bonus movement speed for the full duration as long as Seismic Shard impacts the target. Both a buff shown in the hotbar and duration bar above the ability icon will indicate the remaining duration. Seismic Shard's movement speed gain is entirely based off the target's current, and loss of, movement speed. Targets that are already slowed by another effect will grant Malphite diminished movement speed. Slow-resistant and slow-immune targets will reduce or nullify Malphite's gain. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

PENDING FOR TEST: : Interaction with parrying effects ( dodge , block , blind ). Taking into account Malphite's base attack speed and attack speed growth, he'll be able to use up to 4-6 (levels 1-18) empowered attacks (including the initial one).

Original View in 3D 585 01.09.2009 A massive creature of living stone, Malphite was born from the heart of the great Ixtali construct known as the Monolith. He has studied the elemental balance of Runeterra for centuries, using his tremendous strength to maintain order in a frequently chaotic world, and crush the dark things that crawl beneath it. Now, roused all too often from his slumbers, Malphite endures the fluid temperaments of mortals, in pursuit of the only cause worthy of the last of his kind.

The guy could use a little luck.

For every vessel that docks, another runs aground of coral that was not there before. It's as though even the seabed has turned against us, slowly moving toward some unfathomable end.” Unknown voice actor Unknown artist Forgotten Depths Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Marble View in 3D 520 21.03.2011 Unknown voice actor Unknown artist Legacy Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Obsidian View in 3D 975 15.08.2011 As great mountains were ripped from their foundations during the rise of the Ashen Lord, from deep beneath them climbed strange, obsidian creatures, freed for the first time after thousands of years.

A single punch from its gauntlets can blow holes through thick titanium sheeting, and such attacks have felled countless monsters.

The second is a nigh-indestructible golem, twenty feet tall, and made from the hull of a legendary gunship. Choose wisely.
