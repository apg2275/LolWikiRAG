If Taliyah is casting an ability or enters champion combat , Rock Surfing cannot occur again for a few seconds. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive The movement speed builds up and decays linearly (by the same amount in the same interval), 25% of the maximum value every 0. 25 seconds. Rock Surfing can interact with player-generated terrain . Dealing default or proc damage does not put Rock Surfing on cooldown. Map-Specific Differences Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit Bonus movement speed increased to 10% − 95% (based on level) . Edit Threaded Volley Threaded Volley COST: 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 Mana COOLDOWN: 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 / 3 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 1000 EFFECT RADIUS: 175 / 225 WIDTH: 200 SPEED: 3600 - 1950 Active: Taliyah barrages 5 Stone Shards in the target direction over 1. 5 seconds that each shatter upon the first enemy hit, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies and revealing them for 0. 5 seconds.

Casting Threaded Volley creates a 400-unit area of Worked Ground at Taliyah's cast location that lasts 30 seconds. While on Worked Ground , Threaded Volley's cast consumes the area to become empowered with a new effect, costing 20 mana and having 50% reduced cooldown, though not below 0. 75 seconds. Empowered Active: Taliyah hurls a Boulder that explodes upon the first enemy hit, dealing 190% damage to them and normal damage to nearby enemies, slowing all targets hit for 1. 5 seconds, and revealing them for 0. 5 seconds.

Spell shield only prevents one instance of damage. Edit Seismic Shove Seismic Shove COST: 40 / 30 / 20 / 10 / 0 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 12. 5 / 11 / 9. 5 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 900 EFFECT RADIUS: 225 Active: Taliyah marks the target location and selects a direction.

Hide Details Info Targeting input Vector Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked The delay is measured from the start of the cast, before the cast time. Edit Unraveled Earth Unraveled Earth COST: 90 / 95 / 100 / 105 / 110 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 800 ANGLE: 80° Active: Taliyah scatters a field of 22 stones across the ground in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies hit while they erupt. The stones then remain for 4 seconds and slow enemies within the area by 20%. Magic Damage: 60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 (+ 60% AP) Enemies that dash or are knocked over a stone will detonate it, taking magic damage and becoming stunned for 0. 75 seconds, increased to 2 seconds if they're a monster , after the movement ends. Detonation Magic Damage: 25 / 45 / 65 / 85 / 105 (+ 30% AP) An enemy can detonate up to 4 stones, but the damage is reduced by 0% − 75% (based on stones detonated) . Unraveled Earth can affect targets only once per cast; the stones will still detonate but not apply their effects. Total Maximum Detonation Damage: 62. 5 / 112. 5 / 162. 5 / 212. 5 / 262. 5 (+ 75% AP) Unraveled Earth deals 175% damage against monsters . Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Unraveled Earth fires 6 rows of stones: the first row has 2 stones, and the rest have 4 each. The stones spawn in rows that cascade in 0. 17 second intervals. Unraveled Earth will not detonate if the target dashes over the stones while being untargetable. Unraveled Earth will not detonate against enemies that blink onto the stones. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Edit Weaver's Wall Weaver's Wall COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 180 / 150 / 120 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 2500 / 4500 / 6500 RANGE: 700 SPEED: 1500 / 1200 Active: Taliyah summons a torrent of spiraling rocks that cascades in the target direction, knocking aside champions hit and erecting a wall of terrain in its wake. The wall lasts for 4 seconds after completion, then slowly disintegrates from its starting point. Taliyah also channels for 1 second, during which Weaver's Wall can be recast and she reveals herself. Recast: Upon completing the channel , Taliyah surfs on the wall as it emerges, revealing herself in the process. After 0. 75 seconds, she may input a movement command to jump off the wall to the target location, and automatically does so upon being immobilized or polymorphed or reaching maximum range. Once the wall has fully formed, Taliyah can recast to destroy the wall instantly. Weaver's Wall is placed on a 3-second static cooldown upon taking champion or turret damage. Link ▶️ "Let's shake things up." Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction / Auto Insufficient dash range Dash will gain bonus range through terrain. Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded Not Blocked Blocked Disabled Knockdown Disruption Interrupted Interrupted The jump off distance can be extended to up to 1000 units when targeting across terrain. The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. However neither recasts do. Taliyah can recast to destroy the wall even if she did not surf it or it is in the process of disintegrating. Taliyah almost always jumps off of the wall to her left from when it reaches maximum range. If she is forced to jump off of the wall, she will do so towards the source that dealt damage or applied the crowd control to her. Weaver's Wall , while channeling , can be recast while grounded but not while rooted . Wind Wall and Blade Whirl will prevent Weaver's Wall from summoning any further but does not destroy any initial terrain it spawned. If Taliyah is surfing during the collision, she immediately becomes stunned for 0. 25 seconds, interrupting the surf. If Taliyah would enter terrain and the wall reaches maximum range inside, she is preemptively forced off the wall before entering. The wall can surpass the edges of the map, but Taliyah cannot. Dealing damage to a ward or trap does not trigger Weaver's Wall's 3-second cooldown.

For all associated collection items, see Taliyah (Collection) . Original View in 3D 975 17.05.2016 Taliyah is a nomadic mage from Shurima, torn between teenage wonder and adult responsibility. She has crossed nearly all of Valoran on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers, though more recently she has returned to protect her tribe. Some have mistaken her compassion for weakness and paid the ultimate price—for beneath Taliyah’s youthful demeanor is a will strong enough to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the earth itself tremble.

Locked to their island, Taliyah's people viewed them not as a threat, but as an extension of nature. Now in symbiotic harmony with the crystals on their bodies, Taliyah's people are stronger than ever, and she ventures to the mainland to put her powers to the test.
