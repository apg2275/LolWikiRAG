Challenger and Grandmaster are still limited to the top couple hundred accounts on the server, but players must also have at least 200 LP in Master to reach Grandmaster, and at least 500 LP in Grandmaster to reach Challenger. Grandmaster and Challenger are no longer locked at the start of the season, so the race to be the first in your region starts on day one. Game [ ] Life steal When it comes to added damage on attacks, life steal applies to all effects labelled as on-hit (as denoted with a yellow sword). Currently, this type of effect is only found on items, not champions. Shop We've improved and standardized text editing across the shop and chat so things like CTRL+A to select all, cut, copy, and paste work as expected. Text editing works with mouse clicks for cursor positioning and drag selection. Items displayed in the shop build tree are now vertically centered. When selling a stacked item like a potion or ward, the stack will remain selected and only a single instance of the item will be sold. Pressing O and P at the same time no longer places the shop into an OP state where the scoreboard and shop overlap each other. Many bug fixes and performance improvements.
