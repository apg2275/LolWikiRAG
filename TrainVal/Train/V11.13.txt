Moonlight Vigil Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where he would heal from spells instead of basic attacks when using it with Severum . Cassiopeia Miasma Bug Fix: Grounded debuff is now non-dispellable. This prevents the debuff from being briefly removed by cleanses even while the player remains in the AoE. Because of this, Olaf's Ragnarok fails to dispell and become immune to the effect for the remaining duration unless he leaves and reenters it. (bug) Dr. Mundo Goes Where He Pleases Bug Fix: Now prevents Mordekaiser's Realm of Death from bringing Dr. Mundo to the Death Realm; no longer prevents the initial slow being applied.

This prevents the debuff from being briefly removed by cleanses even while the player remains in the AoE.

Zac's Stretching Strikes still has this issue. Soraka Equinox Bug Fix: Silence debuff is now non-dispellable.

Active: Tahm Kench swallows the target champion for up to 3 seconds, rendering them vanished and unable to act , as well as granting them displacement immunity for the duration. Devour can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically at the end of the duration. Devour will not automatically recast while Tahm Kench is performing Abyssal Dive , and will instead do so after he has finished. If the target is an ally, they are granted a 300 / 450 / 600 (+ 100% AP) shield for 2. 5 seconds, refreshing after being spat out. Allies can exit at will by inputting a movement command, unless they're immobilized or the recast is on cooldown.
