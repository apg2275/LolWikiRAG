Bonus Range: 80 / 160 / 240 Active: Naafiri prepares her grand hunt, immediately despawning all active Packmates then summoning the maximum number of new ones along with extra Packmates . She grants herself and all Packmates bonus movement speed that decays over 4 seconds and is reduced upon taking non- minion damage. She also grants sight of the surrounding area for 2 seconds, and reveals nearby enemy champions for 4 seconds.

Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Counters Spell shield Not Blocked Naafiri can move during The Call of the Pack's cast time. While The Call of the Pack is active, it increases We Are More's summon cap to 4 / 6 / 7 (based on level) . If We Are More is on cooldown when The Call of the Pack is cast, its current cooldown is also reduced by 50%. Darkin Daggers' bleeding effect does not count as a hit for gaining the shield. When The Call of the Pack refreshes, Naafiri will trigger all effects of the ability a second time. If the effect refreshes without Naafiri ever gaining a shield, she will gain the shield automatically upon the refresh. In this case, she will not gain the second shield automatically and will have to hit a champion in the duration to receive it. The first and second shield do not stack with each other. Hitting a champion with the first shield only refreshes its duration. In a similar case, if she has the shield and the refresh occurs, the shield's duration will also be refreshed. If that shield had mitigated some damage, then its strength will also be restored. The second shield can no longer be gained in this case. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. The revealed area and revealed enemy champions are determined based on Naafiri's location when the cast time completes and Naafiri does not reveal and additional area or champions where she moves to, nor any champions that enter the revealed area after the point in time. The additional Packmates that despawn are predetermined by an order, most likely their internal unit (spawn) IDs. It does not consider which Packmates are the closest or healthiest.

Subsequent hits against the same target will refresh the duration, while hits on a different target will switch their focus and command them to attack that target. Darkin Daggers will command them to attack the first target hit that is not a minion. Hounds' Pursuit will command them to attack the first target they themselves collide with. Eviscerate will command them to attack the nearest target hit by the flurry, prioritizing champions. Target type Minion , does not count towards the minion kill tracking score On-hit effects Packmates' attacks are mitigated by dodge , block , and blind . Spell effects Packmates' basic attacks apply spell effects as area damage . Protection Packmates take 200% damage from melee champion basic attacks, 76% − 50% (based on level) damage from area damage , and 50% damage from non-epic monsters and minions. Turret attacks will instantly kill Packmates . Abilities Mutilation After Naafiri casts an ability, Packmates deal 「 30% increased damage 」 「 7. 8 − 38. 74 (based on level) (+ 5. 85 % bonus AD) physical damage 」 on their next basic attack within 3 seconds. They can store up to 3 empowered attacks at a time. Pouncing Assault Packmates will dash to visible targets hit by Naafiri's basic attacks and abilities within 1300 units. They will also windup and dash alongside Naafiri when she uses Hounds' Pursuit , becoming untargetable in the process. Recalling of the Pack When Naafiri casts Eviscerate , Packmates vanish immediately. After her dash ends, they reappear near her landing point. Replenish Packmates are healed to full health both when Naafiri casts Eviscerate or the hunt from The Call of the Pack is refreshed or ends. The Call of the Pack Packmates become empowered during The Call of the Pack , 「 gaining 25% bonus health . 」 「 increasing their maximum health to 100 − 440 (based on level) . 」 General [ ] Packmates will die with Naafiri when she does. Packmates level up with Naafiri . Packmates dynamically override their attack speed and movement speed values with Naafiri's . Packmates cannot have their attack speed and movement speed values be modified on their own, with one exception: They gain a movement speed boost when approximately 400-450 or more units away from Naafiri while she moves away from them. The boost scales based on how far away she is, capping at a total of 1000 movement speed with a proximity of 700 units. When Naafiri enters a brush , Packmates increase their movement speed to 800 and dash to the brush's location if it is within approximately 450 units. This dash can surpass terrain although the Packmates will not dash if they are not already within dash range. In that case, they will navigate and path around the terrain towards the brush. Packmates are summoned before Naafiri to the right, left, or backside of her and will follow her in an arrow-like formation that resembles a pack of wolves. If Naafiri enters stealth , her Packmates will do so as well. After Naafiri completes a Recall , Teleport , or Gate channel, Packmates will blink to her location at the destination. Packmates can still blink from Eviscerate while immobilized , grounded , or silenced . Packmates will occasionally score the killing blow on nearby enemy minions that are under a certain health threshold. The specific mechanisms are intentionally unconfirmed so to remain unreliable. Internal cooldown of this effect seems to be static and in the range of 10 seconds. The target minion needs to be in a health range that leaves them to be killed in a single hit by a Packmate . They will not perform this action while Naafiri is inside of a brush. Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins.
