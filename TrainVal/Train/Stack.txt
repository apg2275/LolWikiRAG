For other uses of Stack , see Stack (Disambiguation) A stack refers to a buff or debuff that can be increased in count under certain circumstances. Stacking effects with durations will refresh per instance, unless otherwise stated. Stacking effects that time out will cause all stacks to expire at once. Hecarim's Rampage , Jax's Relentless Assault , Jinx's Pow-Pow , Lillia's Prance , Tahm Kench's An Acquired Taste , Trinity Force ( Infinity Force ), Demolish , and Lethal Tempo are exceptions to this rule and their stacking effects will expire in intervals.
