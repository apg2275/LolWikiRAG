If she is attached to an ally or does so within 4 seconds, they are healed for the same amount. Innate: While attached to an ally, Yuumi grants them 2 permanent Friendship stacks whenever they kill enemy champions or minions. The ally with the highest Friendship stacks becomes Yuumi's Best Friend , which empowers her abilities with additional effects while she is attached to them. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Feline Friendship will not be consumed if Yuumi isn't missing health, except when triggered by a basic attack. While attached , it won't be consumed if both Yuumi and her anchor aren't missing health. Edit Prowling Projectile Prowling Projectile COST: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 6. 5 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 850 WIDTH: 60 SPEED: 1950 / 850 / 1650 Active: Yuumi fires an errant missile in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first enemy hit. If the target is a champion, they are also revealed and slowed by 20% for 1 second. Magic Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 / 210 (+ 20% AP) Attached Bonus: Yuumi channels for up to 1. 35 seconds to steer the missile at a slower speed. After being in flight for the same duration, the missile accelerates in its current direction to deal increased damage and apply a stronger slow against champions that decays to 20% over 2 seconds. Increased Damage: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 / 355 (+ 35% AP) Enhanced Slow: 50 / 53 / 56 / 59 / 62 / 65% Best Friend Bonus: Prowling Projectile always applies its enhanced slow against champions and hitting a champion grants her Best Friend bonus magic damage on-hit for 5 seconds, increased by 0% − 75% (based on Anchor's critical strike chance) . Bonus Magic Damage On-Hit: 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 (+ 5% AP) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Disruption Blocked Blocked Interrupted Prowling Projectile is able to turn clockwise or counter-clockwise at a rate of 90° per 0. 5 seconds. The missile can turn a maximum of 243° in both directions combined before accelerating. Prowling Projectile can be buffered 0. 5 seconds before it comes off cooldown. Prowling Projectile is slower when attached (before the acceleration). If Yuumi unattaches after using it, the missile will go back to its normal speed, without losing the acceleration later. This results in the fastest and longest ranged version of this ability. The following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is channeling : Type Channel Attacking N/A Abilities Detaching and Final Chapter interrupt. Zoomies is usable.

CAST TIME: none STATIC COOLDOWN : 10 / 5 / 0 (based on level) TARGET RANGE: 700 SPEED: 1200 / 1300 / 1400 / 1500 / 1600 Passive: While Yuumi is attached , she is untargetable (except by turrets and inbound projectiles ) and casts her abilities from the Anchor's position, empowering them with additional effects. Active: Yuumi channels for 0. 25 seconds, then dashes to the target allied champion and attaches to them upon arrival, designating them as her Anchor . You and Me! can be recast after 0. 5 seconds. Recast: Yuumi detaches from her Anchor and dashes to the target allied champion to attach to them, refreshing the recast. She will detach automatically if her Anchor dies or under certain circumstances . If recast without a valid target, Yuumi will detach and dash 250-units in the target direction, placing You and Me! on a 0. 25 -second cooldown if it is not already on cooldown. Yuumi will be knocked down by any immobilizing or polymorphing crowd control during the dash. Yuumi starts with a skill point in You and Me! and Prowling Projectile instead has 6 ranks. Best Friend Bonus: Yuumi gains heal and shield power and her Best Friend gains healing on-hit . You and Me! is placed on a 5-second cooldown if Yuumi becomes immobilized , grounded , or polymorphed . Heal and Shield Power: 5 / 7. 5 / 10 / 12. 5 / 15% Healing On-Hit: 3 / 5 / 7 / 9 / 11 (+ 4% AP) Link ▶️ "Book, meet new friend!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit / Direction Counters Grounded Knockdown Disruption Disabled Interrupted Interrupted The Best Friend's healing on-hit is affected by Yuumi's heal and shield power. Yuumi will track the target if they change locations. She will not stop tracking the target until she reaches them, as there is no maximum tracking distance. The 0. 5 -second cooldown will be incurred whenever Yuumi attaches to an Anchor , whether by the active or the recast. If the target moves 2000 or more units away during the dash, it will be interrupted and You and Me! will be placed on full cooldown. The ability name for the recast is Change of Plan . You and Me! does not count as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. You and Me! does not count as a buff for Summon Aery . Yuumi can channel the Eye of the Herald while attached. Yuumi will automatically detach in the following circumstances: When her Anchor starts a Teleport channel. After the Anchor completes a Recall channel. When she or her Anchor enters resurrection . Her Anchor is sent to the Realm of Death . She is pulled by Fate's Call . Yuumi can dash to targetable zombie state allies (currently only Sion's Glory in Death ), but she cannot attach when she reaches them. The same goes for allies channeling Teleport . While attached to the Anchor , Yuumi is considered in being at her Anchor's position, regardless of where she is visually placed near them. For example, turret shots will appear as if they were hitting the Anchor , but in reality they're actually hitting Yuumi . However, for the purposes of You and Me! , such as casting it or being unattached for other reasons, Yuumi will be in the position where she visually is. For example, when she is in the blue team, dashing to a north-east ally is considerably slower than dashing to a south-west ally. Her monster aggression transfers to the Anchor . Enemies gain an assist on Yuumi if they damaged the Anchor . Yuumi will always be visible if her Anchor can be seen, and she will always not be visible if her Anchor cannot be seen. These rules apply regardless of reveal effects and stealth . Yuumi will not vanish if her Anchor does. If Yuumi is on the blue team, she will remain attached on the southwest side; if Yuumi is on the red team, she will remain on the northeast. While channeling Final Chapter , she will be behind her Anchor . Yuumi doesn't detach instantly when her Anchor dies. There's a small grace period in which she can recast You and Me! to attach to another champion without the channel . The player's screen will briefly flash red if Yuumi is affected by a immobilizing or grounding effect, or if she forcibly detaches from her Anchor . The Anchor's health bar will have a different frame to indicate the attached status: The following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is channeling : Type Channel Attacking Disabled Abilities Disabled Movement Disabled Items Usable Shurelya's Battlesong Youmuu's Ghostblade Randuin's Omen Disabled All the other item-actives are disabled Interrupted by N/A Consumables Usable Spells Usable Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Disabled Teleport Recall Hexflash Interrupted by Flash Interrupted by Death Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects The following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is attached : Attacking Disabled Abilities Allowed Movement Disabled Items Usable All the other item-actives are usable Disabled Hextech Rocketbelt Stridebreaker Interrupted by N/A Consumables Usable Spells Usable Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Disabled Flash Teleport Recall Hexflash Interrupted by N/A Interrupted by Death Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Heal and shield power changed to 10 / 13. 75 / 17. 5 / 21. 25 / 25%.

Allied champions hit by the waves are healed , with each heal instance beyond maximum health being converted into a shield that lasts for 1. 5 seconds plus the remaining channel duration instead. Heal per Hit: 25 / 40 / 55 (+ 15% AP) Total Heal: 125 / 200 / 275 (+ 75% AP) Enemies struck by the waves take magic damage and are slowed by 10% for 1. 25 seconds, which stacks and refreshes on subsequent hits, up to an effectiveness of 50%. Subsequent waves on enemies hit deal 25% damage. Magic Damage per Hit: 75 / 100 / 125 (+ 20% AP) Reduced Damage per Hit: 18. 75 / 25 / 31. 25 (+ 5% AP) Total Magic Damage: 150 / 200 / 250 (+ 40% AP) Attached Bonus: Yuumi can steer the direction of the waves if initially cast while attached. Detaching causes her to lose this bonus for the duration. Additionally, Feline Friendship can trigger from also hitting allied champions. Best Friend Bonus: Final Chapter's heal to the Best Friend is increased by 30%. Best Friend Heal per Hit: 32. 5 / 52 / 71. 5 (+ 19. 5 % AP) Best Friend Total Heal: 162. 5 / 260 / 357. 5 (+ 97. 5 % AP) Link ▶️ "THIS IS MY FAVORITE CHAPTER!!"

Yuumi's facing direction during the channel is considered to be in Final Chapter's target direction.

When her master mysteriously disappeared, Yuumi became the Keeper of Norra's sentient Book of Thresholds, traveling through portals in its pages to search for her. Yearning for affection, Yuumi seeks friendly companions to partner with on her journey, protecting them with luminous shields and fierce resolve. While Book strives to keep her on task, Yuumi is often drawn to worldly comforts, such as naps and fish. In the end, however, she always returns to her quest to find her friend.
