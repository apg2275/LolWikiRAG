Frozen Thralls are ice spirits that have 33. 48 − 325 (based on seconds) movement speed and slow nearby enemies by 25%. They will chase nearby visible enemies for 4 seconds, prioritizing champions , after which they shatter to deal 120 − 520 (based on level) (+ 50% AP) magic damage to nearby enemies. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Thralls are units that are considered champions (they are clones ) and they take the form of the champion they arise from. Additionally, near the end of their life span, they will cue that champion's basic attack animation. They cannot be teleported by an allied Realm Warp . Thralls are untargetable and invulnerable . Thralls are revealed to enemies through the fog of war. Thralls will continue to chase their target even if they enter a brush . Iceborn Subjugation will not summon a Thrall against enemy champions that enter a zombie state , and will instead summon one after they've left the state. Edit Ice Shard Ice Shard COST: 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 Mana COOLDOWN: 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 825 / 950 WIDTH: 150 / 180 SPEED: 2200 Active: Lissandra launches a shard of ice in the target direction that deals magic damage and slows enemies hit for 1. 5 seconds. Magic Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 80% AP) Slow: 20 / 24 / 28 / 32 / 36% If Ice Shard hits an enemy, it will shatter, increasing its width and maximum range. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Ice Shard picks a location 950 units away in the direction of the cast for the shattered missile to end up at. The initial Ice Shard missile has a range of 700 units which it arrives at after 0. 33 seconds . If it hasn't collided with an enemy in this path when it does, it checks for enemies in a 100 radius around the point 25 units in front of it. Colliding or hitting an enemy in either fashion creates a new "shattered" missile with the same speed but greater width that continues to travel along the same line to the designated point 950 units from the cast's original position, originating at the location at which the initial missile collided at. Spell shield will block the damage and the slow but will not stop the projectile from shattering. Edit Ring of Frost Ring of Frost COST: 40 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 450 Active: Lissandra freezes nearby enemies, dealing magic damage and rooting them for a duration. Magic Damage: 70 / 105 / 140 / 175 / 210 (+ 70% AP) Root Duration: 1. 25 / 1. 35 / 1. 45 / 1. 55 / 1. 65 Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked No additional information. Edit Glacial Path Glacial Path COST: 80 / 85 / 90 / 95 / 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 24 / 21 / 18 / 15 / 12 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 1025 WIDTH: 250 SPEED: 1200 / 640 Active: Lissandra sends a claw of ice in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies it passes through, decelerating over 1. 25 seconds. Glacial Path can be recast after 0. 5 seconds while the claw is active. Magic Damage: 70 / 105 / 140 / 175 / 210 (+ 60% AP) Recast: Lissandra consumes the claw and blinks to its current location. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction / Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded Blocked Blocked See Notes Both casts count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Lissandra can reactivate Glacial Path for the duration (plus another 0. 2 -0. 3 seconds after the claw 'sinks' into the ground). The Claw can also hit enemies near the end point at this time, shortly after the missile has reached its maximum range. Glacial Path allows Lissandra to surpass through every single wall in all maps, so long as the claw is at least halfway through them. Glacial Path cannot be recast while grounded or rooted . Glacial Path's endpoint shows through terrain, fog of war and brush to enemies within 600 range of it. Edit Frozen Tomb Frozen Tomb COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 375 / None TARGET RANGE: 550 EFFECT RADIUS: 550 Active: Lissandra can cast Frozen Tomb on herself or an enemy champion. Enemy Cast: Lissandra freezes the target enemy champion, knocking them down and stunning them for 1. 5 seconds. Self Cast: Lissandra instantly entombs herself in ice, entering stasis for 2. 5 seconds and healing herself every 0. 25 seconds over the duration. The healing is increased by 0% − 100% (based on missing health at the time of cast) . Minimum Heal per Tick: 10 / 15 / 20 (+ 5. 5 % AP) Maximum Heal per Tick: 20 / 30 / 40 (+ 11 AP) Minimum Total Heal: 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 55% AP) Maximum Total Heal: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 110% AP) Frozen Tomb creates a field of ice that spreads out from the target over 1. 5 seconds and covers the surrounding area for 3 seconds, dealing magic damage to enemies and slowing them for 0. 5 seconds, refreshing every 0. 25 seconds while they remain. Magic Damage: 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 75% AP) Slow: 30 / 52. 5 / 75% Link ▶️ "Entomb!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Area damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield See Notes Enemies can only be damaged by the field of ice once every 4 seconds. Under normal circumstances, this means once per cast of Frozen Tomb . Enemies who come in contact with Frozen Tomb's slow field will be damaged and a small visual and sound effect will play. Spell shield will block the single-targeted portion and the radiating ice damage, but will not stop it from spreading. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost. This only applies to the enemy cast.

Original View in 3D 880 29.04.2013 As the reclusive leader of the Frostguard, many believe Lissandra is a living saint whose followers bring healing and wisdom to the tribes of the Freljord. The truth is perhaps more sinister, as she uses her elemental magic to twist the power of True Ice into something dark and terrible, entombing or impaling any who would reveal her deepest secrets. Indeed, the legacy of her past may yet be the beginning of the end for Runeterra. Tess Masters Alex 'alexplank' Flores Loot eligible Bloodstone View in 3D 975 29.04.2013 Once a powerful sorceress who sought absolute control over her followers, Lissandra transformed into something altogether different when she finally found the hallowed Bloodstone. The magic she drew from it drove her to slay those who once tended to her every whim. To this day she wanders in search of more mortals to sacrifice to her newfound source of power. Tess Masters Michelle Hoefener Bloodstone Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Blade Queen View in 3D 1350 26.05.2014 Ruler of a once mighty city, Lissandra was seduced by the promises of a monstrous shadow, whispering of esoteric power and eternal life. For this, she betrayed her people and gave them to darkness, so that in the shadow's womb she would be reborn an ageless monster. Tess Masters Christian Fell Omen of the Dark Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Program View in 3D 1350 06.04.2016 Built as an all-seeing security bot, Program Lissandra rose above her initial code to become a self-generating artificial intelligence. She manipulates the technology of augmented humans with her own mimetic commands, so that all will fall before her. Tess Masters Esben Lash Rasmussen Program Loot eligible Voice filter Additional/unique quotes New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Coven View in 3D 1350 27.11.2018 They came to Lissandra as if in some waking dream—visions of the Ivory Stag, and the old magics long lost to antiquity. Even now, the ageless witch resides among those twisted shadows of the old growth, awaiting the day her dead gods spill forth from their rotten and accursed graves. Tess Masters Kelly Aleshire Coven Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Coven Lissandra Chromas Aquamarine Dark Ritual Meteorite Obsidian Rose Quartz Ruby Sandstone Tanzanite Dark Cosmic View in 3D 1350 24.11.2020 Once a cosmic entity charged with identifying future threats to the cosmos, her hunger for ever greater knowledge drew her into conflict with the Dark Star, which consumed her. Transformed into a mad doomsayer who sees a “true” universe in the ashes of this one, she has become the very end she once feared.

Cast down and sealed away for her crimes, Lissandra spent centuries of solitude scheming a way to take all twelve Zodiac Relics for herself, waiting for the perfect time to strike... And now Ezreal has given her the chance. Tess Masters Jiunn Kuo, West Studio Porcelain Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Porcelain Lissandra Chromas Amethyst Aquamarine Catseye Emerald Golden Tiger Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Prestige Porcelain View in 3D Special 26.01.2023 What is fashion, if not sculpture? Is it not beauty and elegance in physical form? The portrait of glamor in white, blue, and gold, Lissandra is a work of art, on and off the runway. Tess Masters Ina Wong, West Studio Porcelain Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall This skin is a variant of Porcelain . Store variants are discounted for multiple purchases. Space Groove View in 3D 1350 17.11.2022 Brutal alien leader of the Harsh Vibes, Lissandra subjugates planets rich in The Groove for her own nefarious purposes—banning disco and steeping the entire galaxy in Muzak. She and her army of roller-skating derby goons will stop at nothing to eliminate disco forever. But for her latest scheme to work, she's going to need an invite to the disco to end all discos: The Jam. Tess Masters Jeremy Chong, West Studio Space Groove Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Space Groove Lissandra Chromas Catseye Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rainbow Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Lissandra first appeared in the Journal of Justice , Issue 2 , several years before her announcement as a champion. Like now, she was portrayed as the leader of one of the three tribes of the Freljord, but her portrayal was originally vastly different, as a mortal princess allied with Ashe 's tribe. This was later revealed to be her alter ego, and most people are not aware of her being the Ice Witch herself. If Ashe, Lissandra, and/or Sejuani are played on opposing teams, Battle for Freljord will trigger. This in-game quest consists in one killing the other to earn the title of 'Queen of Freljord' (complete with a floating ice crown floating above their heads) referencing the civil war taking place there, between the three tribes each lead. Lissandra is the only champion to possess a single-targeted ability ( Frozen Tomb ) that can be used on herself but not on allies. Lissandra, Elise , and Lucian are the only champions to feature a monologue on their login screens. Lissandra may be the feminine form of Greek name Λύσανδρος (Lysander or "liberator"). Her champion theme is the same as the pick music of ARAM and is titled "Freljord".
