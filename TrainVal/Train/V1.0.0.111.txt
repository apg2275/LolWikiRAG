Totemic Maokai Charred Maokai Longhorn Alistar The following skins were released along with this patch, but were not available for purchase until Tuesday, February 22. High Command Katarina Vandal Twitch PVP.net v1.29.23 Created a new UI flow for joining games of all types. Updated the Friend List UI. Runes are now stacked in the Summoner profile. Co-op vs. AI Announcement This mode was stated to be released a few days after this patch went live, but it was actually released on March 10, several days after the next patch. This mode pits a team of all human players against a team of all AI bots on Summoner's Rift. This mode is supported by matchmaking, and allows summoners to join the queue solo or with friends. Summoners may choose between two AI bot difficulty settings: Beginner or Intermediate. IP and XP rewards are earned, and adjusted based on summoner level and difficulty setting. The following bots are enabled for Co-op vs. AI: Annie Ashe Cho'Gath Miss Fortune Nunu Renekton Ryze Shen Soraka Taric Trundle Warwick XP & IP Rate Changes We have completely overhauled the IP and XP system in order to make it more fair. Our intention was to leave the overall XP and IP gained by players unchanged. Previously, IP and XP were awarded for winning or losing a game. Now, they are granted based on how long the game was, and whether you won or lost. In a long game, you will make significantly more XP and IP than before. However, in a very short game, you will make less IP and XP. We found it frustrating to be stuck in an hour long games, and then get what was effectively 30 minutes of IP reward. When calculating the number of minutes the game took, we only award for actual game time. However, we give all games a small fixed bonus reward, which is to give you credit for time in queue and champion selection. Other details: We have also tweaked the formulas so that new players get larger quantities of IP in their first 10 or so levels so that they can unlock their first Champions more quickly. First Win of the Day remains unchanged – it is still a flat bonus you will receive when you are eligible. We removed the no-leave-streak bonus and increased the IP rewards in general to compensate. The reason we did this is because we felt that with the new LeaverBuster system, this was no longer necessary. League of Legends V1.0.0.111 Champions Maokai, the Twisted Treant Sap Magic (Innate): Each time a champion near Maokai casts a spell, he gains a charge of Magical Sap. When he has 5 charges, Maokai's next melee attack drains energy from his target, healing him for a percentage of his maximum health. Arcane Smash : Maokai slams the ground, the force of which knocks nearby enemies back and sends an arcane shockwave forward, damaging and slowing his enemies. Twisted Advance : Maokai dissolves into a cloud of arcane energies. He regrows near a target enemy, dealing damage and rooting it in place. Sapling Toss : Maokai hurls a sapling, dealing damage on impact. The sapling becomes implanted in the ground, warding a nearby area. When enemies approach, the sapling attacks, exploding in an arcane blast that damages enemies. Vengeful Maelstrom (Ultimate): Maokai shields his allies by drawing power from hostile spells and attacks, reducing non-tower damage done to allied champions in the area. Maokai can prolong the effect as long as he has mana to spend on it. When the effect ends, Maokai unleashes the absorbed energy to deal damage to enemies within the vortex.
