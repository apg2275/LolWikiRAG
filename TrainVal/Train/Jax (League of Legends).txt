Original View in 3D 585 21.02.2009 Unmatched in both his skill with unique armaments and his biting sarcasm, Jax is the last known weapons master of Icathia. After his homeland was laid low by its own hubris in unleashing the Void, Jax and his kind vowed to protect what little remained. As magic now rises in the world, this slumbering threat stirs once more, and Jax roams Valoran, wielding the last light of Icathia and testing all warriors he meets to see if any are strong enough to stand beside him… Erik Braa Foritis Wang, Pandart Studio Loot eligible The Mighty View in 3D 520 12.02.2010 The hockey prodigy known as Jax is feared throughout the tournament circuit for his incredible reflexes and ability to kill a man with any object. There are rumors he used to be a defense attorney, but nobody knows for certain. Erik Braa Lejia Chan, Kudos Productions Winter Sports Loot eligible Legacy Vandal View in 3D 520 24.02.2010 A wandering warrior feared by the wasteland's many roving gangs, Jax casually strolls across miles of broken highway with a two-by-four and a few rusty nails, crushing the heads of anyone he happens to run into. It gets just as ugly as it sounds. Erik Braa Jiunn Kuo, Kudos Productions Vandal Loot eligible Legacy Angler View in 3D 975 08.06.2010 Nothing quite like the peace of the great outdoors, waiting for that perfect bite—and then violently ripping a fish out of the water before hitting it with his fishing rod.

Erik Braa Yuyu Wong, Kudos Productions PAX Loot inelgible Jaximus View in 3D 975 10.05.2011 In a fighters' colosseum, Jax's victories were celebrated by a young kid and dedicated fan, Joe. Jax found that Joe himself was an incredible warrior, far braver than anyone Jax had met. Joe gave Jax the nickname “Jaximus,” a title he heartily accepted. “Here's to you, kid,” declared Jax as he charged into battle, hoisting the lamplight in Joe's honor. Erik Braa Herbie Wang, Kudos Productions Legacy Loot eligible Additional/unique quotes New SFX/VFX Temple View in 3D 750 15.11.2011 Jax's search for inner peace brought him to many temples and the tutelage of various martial masters. His fiery attitude got him in trouble often, but Jax learned to appreciate the schooling. Tempering his battle prowess with a serene, strategic mind, Jax now faces every fight with a renewed unity of mind, body, and spirit. Erik Braa Roanna Peroz, Kudos Productions Legacy Loot eligible Nemesis View in 3D 975 14.09.2012 No one knows what lies beneath the glowing mask. Human, monster, or something more, it wields a violet lantern-mace and travels from conflict to conflict. Yet it always seems to fight on the side of benevolence. Through myths told by wanderers and night merchants, it has become a figure of legend: a phantasm of the dark, standing against darkness. Erik Braa Lejia Chan, Kudos Productions Legacy Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Chromas Nemesis Jax Chromas Amber Brick Cream SKT T1 View in 3D 750 04.05.2014 Honoring Impact's winning performance as Jax during the 2013 World Championship.

While few records can back up his claims, Jax believes the Rune War began with the failure of a legal body founded to curtail political power—when this institute faltered, the fate of all was sealed. Erik Braa Sixmorevodka Studio Warden Loot eligible God Staff View in 3D 1350 11.01.2018 The God Staff was once an earthly champion, who searched fruitlessly for a weapon worthy of his power. At the twilight of his life, he finally came across a staff glowing with the light of the gods—granting him immortality, and even greater strength. Erik Braa Jojo So Immortal Journey Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Mecha Kingdoms View in 3D 1820 15.01.2020 Famed as the greatest weapons master in all the land, Jax has been itching for a proper weapon, and a proper fight. When the best minds of the Estercrest Kingdom came together—using strange technology seemingly gifted to them by the heavens—to construct an indomitable Avalon, Jax was finally impressed. He welcomes the leviathan invasion, hoping these monstrous foes will prove to be the challenge he has been searching for his entire life.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Jax's eyes are blue. Jax was likely inspired by Garet Jax , "The Weapons Master" of the Sword of Shannara Trilogy . He was adept with any weapon and was undefeated in combat, though he often wielded a sword and cudgel. In the V1.0.0.115 ( April Fools' Day ) patch, Wriggle's Lantern was given the following joke passive, referencing Jax's usage of a lamp post (which is functionally similar to a lantern) as a weapon: New Unique Passive : Taunts nearby Jaxes (both enemy and allied). In the now-removed official League of Legends forums , the icon of Relentless Assault was used to represent the "Off Topic Discussion" section. The icon art of Grandmaster's Might features a stunned soldier who was directly mirrored from the original icon for Time Bomb .
