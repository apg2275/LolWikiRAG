Wither's cripple effectiveness calculates from its slow's base values, thus slow resist will not interact with the attack speed modifier indirectly. Both slow and cripple from Wither are considered to be a single debuff . (bug) Therefore, slow immunity will prevent both, even without technical cripple immunity . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).
