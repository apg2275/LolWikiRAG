The magic damage is dealt in an instance before the physical damage . Both instances deal basic damage and thus natively apply life steal . The attack applies on-hit effects only once, right at the start. Even if the target dies from the magic damage , the physical damage will still be applied to it. If the target dies from on-hit damage, the magic damage portion will be skipped and only the physical damage applied. (bug) Spellblade damage is special cased to be converted to magic damage . The damage from Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury is affected by Hextech Munitions' modifier. Critical strikes amplify the damage as usual, multiplying both instances of damage. All players are alerted by Corki emitting a global siren upon picking up The Package . Corki can pick up the package even if he does not have a skill point in Valkyrie .

Magic Damage: 80 / 115 / 150 (+ 25 / 50 / 75% AD) (+ 12% AP) Corki periodically stocks a Missile Barrage charge, up to a maximum of 7. He gains maximum charges upon respawning and when picking up the The Package . Every third missile Corki fires is a Big One , dealing 100% increased damage as well as gaining increased range and explosion radius. Big One Magic Damage: 160 / 230 / 300 (+ 50 / 100 / 150% AD) (+ 24% AP) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Once Corki has learned the ability, he receives a buff that automatically tracks the number of times he's used his ultimate since the last Big One . Since this information is represented as a buff, this information is available to both allies and enemies. Gaining maximum charges from obtaining the The Package does not reset Missile Barrage's recharge timer. Corki retains progress towards The Big One when he dies . Once Corki has his ultimate, he has an indicator below his health bar that is only visible to him that shows when a Big One will be fired, how many missiles he has in reserve, and how many more missiles he can store . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Missile Barrage's effect radius is centered around the location of the missile as it collides. Malignance's damage from Missile Barrage does not counts toward Eclipse's passive. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 70 / 105 / 140.

Original View in 3D 790 18.09.2009 The yordle pilot Corki loves two things above all others: flying, and his glamorous mustache… though not necessarily in that order. After leaving Bandle City, he settled in Piltover and fell in love with the wondrous machines he found there. He dedicated himself to the development of flying contraptions, leading an aerial defense force of seasoned veterans known as the Screaming Yipsnakes. Calm under fire, Corki patrols the skies around his adopted home, and has never encountered a problem that a good missile barrage couldn’t solve. 'Ralph' Unknown artist Loot eligible UFO View in 3D Special 01.01.2010 Everyone said this model wouldn't fly, but Corki's never let himself be discouraged by others being reasonable. 'Ralph' Unknown artist Invaders Loot inelgible Ice Toboggan View in 3D 1820 12.02.2010 Having broken the land-speed record in most other vehicular sports, Corki has turned his attention to the ice luge—a momentum-based activity that doesn't require a state-of-the-art flying sled with a forward-mounted machine gun. He brought one anyway.

'Ralph' Sora Kim, West Studio Astronauts Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Astronaut Corki Chromas Catseye Citrine Emerald Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Tanzanite Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Corki is voiced by an individual named "Ralph" . It was speculated that Corki was inspired by Aurel Vlaicu the Gyrocopter from Dota 2 . This has been proven false given Corki was released on 19-Sep-2009 (patch V0.9.25.21 ) while Gyrocopter was released on 28-Jul-2010 for the original DotA custom map. Yet both of them are most likely based on the Gyrocopter from Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos ( Frozen Throne 's name: Flying machine ). Corki was the first champion to have two Legendary skins as well as the first and only to have three. All of them are old skins that are either Legacy or were never for sale to begin with. Corki's dance references the "Do a barrel roll!" phrase spoken by Peppy Hare in Star Fox 64 . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . In the now-removed official League of Legends forums , the original icon of Missile Barrage was used to represent the "In-Game HUD Discussion" section. The old sound effect for when Corki picks up The Package was similar to an air raid siren , which was pointed out by a player in Syria. [2] It was promptly changed.
