Original View in 3D 975 06.12.2023 Hwei is a brooding painter who creates brilliant art in order to confront Ionia's criminals and comfort their victims. Beneath his melancholy roils a torn, emotional mind—haunted by both the vibrant visions of his imagination and the gruesome memories of his temple's massacre. Hwei seeks to understand this light and dark, which drives him inevitably toward the artist who unraveled him. With paintbrush and palette, Hwei shapes endless possibilities as he draws ever closer to earning closure or embracing despair. Stephen Fu Bo 'chenbowow' Chen Loot eligible Winterblessed View in 3D 1350 06.12.2023 The herald of Polaris, Hwei, waited in a despondent mood. When Senna and Hecarim found him among the world of man, a violent blizzard raged overhead. As herald, he used his brush to paint the Aurora across the skies, bringing the first snow. At Hecarim's beckoning, he waved his brush, parting the clouds to reveal a barren sky. Where was the Aurora?

Hwei's kit obeys the rule of thirds in multiple aspects: He has 3 × 3 basic abilities. His passive requires two damaging abilities in order to deal a third damaging ability. He studies two negative subjects and one positive subject. Riot Emizery posted Wikipedia articles about "The Rule of Thirds" and "The Golden Ratio" a month before Hwei's release on r/HweiMains , implying what his kit was going to be about. Serenity , Hwei's positive mood, is placed between his other two negative moods, anger and anguish . This fact stems from lore implications, namely his inner turmoil, as detailed in his universe short stories - "Hwei faces the conflicting hues of Ionia" in 'The Visionary' and "Art saves me, yet it can shatter me" in 'Paintings Framed in Half-Light'. [2] [3] When Hwei dies, his eyes, that reflect his current mood, fade into a colorless blankness, symbolizing the absence of any emotional presence in death.
