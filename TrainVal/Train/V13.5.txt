League of Legends V13.5 [ ] Client [ ] Store Champion pricing model has been updated. Prices are now based on how many seasons each champion has been in the game for rather than how many champions have been released since. Adjustments to champion shard disenchantment values will be made in V13.7 . Tier criteria has also been updated to reflect this adjustment: 450 / 260 - Champions that have a low skill floor. These champions have a strong fantasy and an approachable kit that helps newer players find success early on. 1350 / 585 - Champions that have a slightly higher skill floor than the previous tier. These champions are still approachable for interested players. They are a bit more complex in that they have more nuanced skill checks in their play patterns, but maintain reasonable skill floors. Most of the popular champions will fit into this tier. 3141 / 880 - Special tier for Vel'Koz . 3150 / 790 - Champions that have an overall high skill floor due to having steep learning curves before one can find success with them. These champions have a larger degree of difficulty or specialization in their play. 4444 / 880 - Special tier for Jhin . 4800 / 880 - Majority of champions in the roster will be in this tier. 6300 / 975 - Champions that have come out in the past two seasons, after which they will move to the tier above after the next season starts. 7800 / 975 - Champions that have come out in the past week.
