This includes but is not limited to normal or special forms of movement, using dashes or blinks , or being displaced to another location. Hitting abilities that apply on-hit effects will also generate 6 stacks. Voltaic Cyclosword's Galvanize increases the generation of Energize stacks by 75% for dashes and blinks as well as while moving in stealth . This means it grants 1. 75 stacks for every 24 units travelled during those effects. Electroshock will not trigger its chain lightning against turrets , but will do so against inhibitors .

Bonus damage changed to 100 − 280 (based on level) . Old icons 1st version Trivia Statikk Shiv is named after James 'Statikk' Bach , a Senior Game Designer at Riot. Prior to V5.22 , Statikk Shiv had the same animation effects and sound with Kennen's Electrical Surge . When activating both Kennen's Electrical Surge and Statikk Shiv passive within a small enough window, whichever was casted second will not have the sound effects replay ( due to the previous exact copy of the sound just previously playing ). The only difference is that Statikk Shiv applies the effect at the seven closest targets, whereas Kennen's Electrical Surge targets all units that are affected by Mark of the Storm .
