If Xerath is displaced by a knockabout or pull effect during the cast time, Arcane Barrage fill still go off at the target location even if he is no longer in range. The outline of the area of effect will appear the moment Xerath begins casting, and deals damage after the 0. 5 delay. After the 0. 2 second casting time, there is no way to stop the blast. There is a 0. 9 second internal cooldown between casts ( 0. 4 seconds after the previous cast has dealt damage ). A cosmetic buff indicates how many casts are left. The sight radius is estimated to be 300. Xerath laughs with each cast, louder with successive casts. Can be heard up to 1800 units away, unless Xerath is in the fog of war.
