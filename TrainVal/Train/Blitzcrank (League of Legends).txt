Mana Barrier's interactions with other shield effects that trigger before taking damage that would reduce below 30% health: Mana Barrier will trigger simultaneously with the Lifeline effect from Hexdrinker , Maw of Malmortius , or Immortal Shieldbow if Blitzcrank takes damage while above 30% health, and trigger before them when the damage is taken while below 30% health. Mana Barrier will always trigger simultaneously with the Lifeline effect from Sterak's Gage if Blitzcrank takes damage while above or below 30% health. Mana Barrier will trigger after Nullifying Orb if Blitzcrank takes damage while above 30% health, and trigger simultaneously with it while below 30% health.

Magic Damage: 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 / 285 (+ 120% AP) Blitzcrank is unable to move or attack while Rocket Grab is in flight. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Rocket Grab's range is composed of a missile with 1080 range, and a smaller center-range area check at the end (colloqially known as a 'lollipop'). The area check is currently half as long as it is supposed to be, reducing the intended 1150 range of the ability to 1115 range. Hitting an enemy with this area check only also fails to play the ability's hit SFX. This makes it possible to easily distinguish whether the target was picked up by the missile collision or 'lollipop'. Targets larger than 95 units in radius can be hit by a different edge-range circle check at the end of the missile. The airborne debuff lasts for up-to 1 second but will end prematurely when the target's movement stops, while the stun will persist (if duration permits). Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun . The target's destination lies 75 units in front of Blitzcrank . If the target is closer than this, the effect will still move them to this location. If this location would be inside static terrain, the target's destination will end up on Blitzcrank's side, even if that means pulling them right on top of Blitzcrank . This can occasionally fail. If Blitzcrank is being moved (e.g. Airborne , Kinematics or Fate's Call ) during the grab, the target will be pulled towards Blitzcrank s old location. Blitzcrank will be ordered to basic attack the target once the target arrives. If the target dies to Rocket Grab's damage, they will not be pulled. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Bonus Attack Speed: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70% Bonus Movement Speed: 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90% When Overdrive ends, Blitzcrank is slowed by 30% for 1. 5 seconds.

This damage is affected by critical strike modifiers. Power Fist resets Blitzcrank's basic attack timer.

The target is displaced a short distance during the knockup in a random direction.

After every 1 second, one stack is consumed to deal them magic damage . Magic Damage: 50 / 100 / 150 (+ 30 / 40 / 50% AP) (+ 2% maximum mana) Active: Blitzcrank detonates a static field, completely destroying damage-mitigating shields of nearby enemies before dealing them magic damage and silencing them for 0. 5 seconds.

The mark will be consumed even if the target becomes untargetable . The lightning bolts deal spell damage while the static field applies area damage . Even if Static Field is blocked by a spell shield , it will still destroy any existing damage shields on the target.

Original View in 3D 790 01.09.2009 Blitzcrank is an enormous, near-indestructible automaton from Zaun, originally built to dispose of hazardous waste. However, he found this primary purpose too restricting, and modified his own form to better serve the fragile people of the Sump. Blitzcrank selflessly uses his strength and durability to protect others, extending a helpful metal fist or burst of energy to subdue any troublemakers.

Ingame and spell descriptions still refer to Blitzcrank using He/Him pronouns. Concept art for a champion codenamed the Iron Engineer was likely incorporated on Blitzcrank. Rocket Grab's icon displays Blitzcrank's left hand even though they use their right one in-game. Their dance references the Macarena dance . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Blitzcrank has been jokingly referred to as a girl by Tom 'Zileas' Cadwell . [2] They resemble Zog from the 2009 Astro Boy movie. Riot's love of ducks has made it so Blitzcrank's feet resemble theirs. Blitzcrank and Amumu were planned to have Sewn Chaos skins, but both were cancelled for failing to meet Riot 's quality standards. They may return in the future. The icon for Rocket Grab is reused for the Teamfight Tactics item Rocket-Propelled Fist . On V12.20 , a change was added to where Power Fist would occasionally knock up non-champion targets it killed " to the moon ".
