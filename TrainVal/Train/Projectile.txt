Wind Wall intercepting Lux's Light Binding . A projectile (or missile ) is any entity not classified as a unit ( champion , minion , monster , etc.) that travels at any given velocity. Almost all projectiles can be blocked or destroyed by Braum's Unbreakable , Samira's Blade Whirl , and Yasuo's Wind Wall . Moving units that are not projectiles are not blocked under any circumstance (including dash abilities and units thrown by abilities, such as Force of Will and Roar of the Slayer ). Some champion summoned units will be knocked down by projectile-blocking effects. Unit-targeted and auto-targeted projectiles can furthermore be destroyed by projectile destroying effects as well.
