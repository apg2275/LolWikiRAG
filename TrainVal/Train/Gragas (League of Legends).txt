Deactivating the ability manually does not. The cask ignores unit and terrain collision therefore it will only stop once it reaches the target location. On arrival the cask will begin to glow ever brighter as it ferments until it turns bright red. Barrel Roll has an internal cooldown while traveling so that Gragas may only make it explode on arrival. The charge-up countdown will only start once the cask stops rolling. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins. For all associated collection items, see Gragas (Collection) . Original View in 3D 790 02.02.2010 Equal parts jolly and imposing, Gragas is a massive, rowdy brewmaster on his own quest for the perfect pint of ale. Hailing from parts unknown, he now searches for rare ingredients among the unblemished wastes of the Freljord, trying each recipe as he goes. Often intoxicated and extremely impulsive, he is legendary for the brawls he starts, which often end in all-night parties and widespread property damage. Any appearance from Gragas must surely foreshadow drinking and destruction—in that order. J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Loot eligible Scuba View in 3D 975 03.05.2010 J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Day Job Loot eligible Legacy Hillbilly View in 3D 520 01.08.2010 J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Legacy Loot eligible Santa View in 3D 975 14.12.2010 Some might say Gragas would be the perfect Santa, and between his jolly frame and wild beard he certainly fits the bill. But Gragas is also very unreliable, constantly intoxicated, and starts fights seemingly at random—but he likes the costume, and no one is brave enough to take it back. J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Snowdown Showdown Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Gragas, Esq. View in 3D 975 12.04.2011 One of the city's top criminal defense attorneys, Gragas, Esquire is often seen carousing with the chief of police and various circuit court judges—mostly because they know he has access to the finest prohibited goods… but also because he's been paying them off for decades. J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Crime City Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Vandal View in 3D 975 02.03.2012 Gragas causes enough trouble to be kicked out of every wasteland settlement twenty times over, but the man found a way to mix potent brew and unrefined gasoline into the staple beverage of the post-apocalypse. Might as well let him wreck a few bars. He's earned it. J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Vandal Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Oktoberfest View in 3D 975 21.09.2012 Gragas is the world's premier authority on beverages. Here, at the international beverage festival and funfair, he's drinking a lot of them. J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Wonders of the World Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Superfan View in 3D 750 18.06.2014 Gragas is Runeterra's biggest Order United fan, and he makes sure everyone knows it by leading chants, foregoing clothing for blue body paint, and making sure everyone around him is “adequately hydrated.” J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Soccer Cup Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Fnatic View in 3D 750 24.09.2014 Honoring Shushei's winning performance as Gragas during the 2011 World Championship. J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist World Champions: 2011 Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Gragas Caskbreaker View in 3D 750 07.12.2015 Gragas Caskbreaker is described in legend as both a pious, sun-worshipping cleric and a despicable drunk, depending on who tells the tale. He's not too familiar with Riftquest, but he does like fighting dragons and passing out in the middle of his combat actions. J.S. Gilbert Unknown artist Rift Quest Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Arctic Ops View in 3D 1350 25.01.2018 A large man even before donning his hermetically sealed arctic combat suit, Gragas is a mystery to all save for High Command's secretive R&D labs. He appears human by all measures, save for the mask he never removes, and the eerily cold mixture of chemicals powering his massive frame. J.S. Gilbert Alex 'alexplank' Flores Arctic Ops Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Warden View in 3D 1350 07.01.2021 The Wardens are a sect of those who choose to don the armor of the Protectorate. Wardens hail from all corners of the world; so long as one holds fast to one's pledge, then one is a Warden. Gragas found purpose in this calling, and found camaraderie in his fellow Wardens, who welcomed him—all of him—with open arms. J.S. Gilbert David Villegas, West Studio Warden Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Warden Gragas Chromas Amethyst Citrine Pearl Peridot Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Turquoise Space Groove View in 3D 1350 17.11.2022 The King of Cool, Gragas is one guy who knows how to party. Bringing the funk with him everywhere he goes, even the denizens of Boogiewonderland acknowledge his prowess for groovin'. If Gragas rolls up to the disco, you know you're in for a wild night. J.S. Gilbert Rio Sabda, Caravan Studio Space Groove Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Space Groove Gragas Chromas Catseye Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rainbow Rose Quartz Ruby Tanzanite Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Gragas is voiced by J.S. Gilbert . Battlecast Prime Cho'Gath , Dr. Mundo , Corporate Mundo , pre- rework Sion , Udyr and Spirit Guard Udyr are also voiced by the same voice actor. Gragas used to be the only Mage / Fighter champion as well as the only melee mage. He is now a Fighter / Mage so until recently there have been no melee mages, with Sylas now taking up that role. (even though most champions with the Mage secondary role are melee). His first title was 'the Cask Master' but was changed to avoid confusion with the Card Master . What appears to be Gragas' cask can be seen in the game's Mac Version trailer. Gragas is the third champion to have 9 skins, behind Ryze and Annie .
