Piercing Arrow (Q) Varus readies and then fires a powerful shot that gains extra range and damage the longer he spends preparing to fire. Blighted Quiver (W) Varus' basic attacks deal bonus magic damage and apply Blight. Varus' other abilities detonate Blight, dealing magic damage based on the target's maximum health. Hail of Arrows (E) Varus fires a hail of arrows that deal physical damage and desecrate the ground. Desecrated ground slows enemies' movement speed and reduces their healing and regeneration.
