For more projects, see the Community To Do List . Additional information: This page has multiple layout issues with its emotes list. It is considered by our editors as suboptimal, and does not meet good usability standards, nor is using galleries the ideal way to catalogue a library of icons. The number of tabbers also significantly hinders users from searching through the page for the emote they are looking for. Many emotes are missing from this page, along with any information about them and how they are specifically unlocked, when they were added, or the categories they fall into. Please also note that logged out users cannot view file pages, which include extra information that may be missed.

A Thumbs Up Emote is freely unlocked for all accounts. They can be equipped through the player's Collection -> Emotes tab, and are partly customizable during the Champion Select screen. Loadout is separated into two emote sections. Emote Wheel : The first section includes the radial wheel that can hold up to nine emotes—one in the center, and eight on a loop. Reactions : The second section has separate slots for in-game events. Currently, those are Start Game , First Blood , Ace , and Victory . The Emotes tab additionally features a search function at the top left to look up emotes by name. Use [ ] Emotes are displayed as a pop-up above a champion's Health Bar for a duration of 3 seconds. They are accompanied by a unique sound effect and may include various animations beyond the flashing-in and flashing-out; these can only be heard and viewed in game. Once in game, you can access the emote wheel using the assigned hotkey (default: Hold T + move Mouse ; tapping the default bind simply casts the center emote). Players can only trigger 6 Emotes, including Champion Mastery emotes, within 10 seconds before having to wait to use another. Note that the Champion Mastery emote has its own assigned hotkey (default: Ctrl + 6 ) . Reactions emotes will trigger automatically, while alive or dead. Each player can only cast 2 emotes at most while dead, including Reactions. Emotes are immediately interrupted and temporarily disabled by receiving champion damage and death. Allies' emotes will additionally display in a bubble at the top left of the screen (maximum 3 at a time). You can mute a player's emotes individually from the Scoreboard; muting a player/players through the /mute command will automatically mute their emotes. Through Settings, emotes' sizes can be adjusted, the bubble display can be configured or turned off, and there also exists a single option for toggling enemy emotes.

These icons were tied to having specific Summoner icons equipped, their use was limited to the duration of the event in which they were introduced, and they replaced the Champion Mastery flare. Should these Emotes return in the future, they will be incorporated into the new system and will be freely gifted to players who previously earned them. Patch 7.24 reintroduced six of these former Emotes into the new system.

Not right away, but we'll be on the lookout for ways to bring back emotes from past events (like Arcade or Versus). We don't plan to bring back any Esports emotes. If we bring back an emote that you've already earned, we'll gift it to you. Can I gift emotes? Not right now, but hopefully in the future. Will emotes be added to loot? Not yet, but we'll add them eventually. Currently, Hextech and Masterwork Chests can drop random Emotes that you don't own. How do I mute emotes? There are two ways to mute emotes. You can mute all enemy emotes in the in-game settings menu, or mute individual player emotes through the scoreboard. Will muting emotes also mute the champion mastery emote? Yes. Champion mastery emotes are now part of the emotes system, so they follow all the same rules. My emotes don't work after I've used a few. What's up with that? Emotes will go on cooldown if overused, or if your emote is interrupted by taking damage. We may adjust the length of these cooldowns in the future. Emotes also don't work in custom matches or on the Practice Tool. Are all emotes going to be 350 RP? They'll launch at 350 RP, but they'll return to their normal price of 450 RP a month after release (October 24 for OCE, Nov. 7 everywhere else). Are Worlds emotes permanent? Yeah! Will there be more emotes bundles? Yes! We plan to create more emotes bundles some time after launch. (OCE only) I bought the individual emotes in the bundle before the bundle came out. Refund please! Since bundles weren't immediately available in OCE, we'll refund the difference between the price and what you paid by November 11 at 12:59 PM PT. Emotes in the bundle cost about 131 RP each (that's a 70% savings off the 450 RP price). So partial refunds look like this: If you bought	You paid	Your refund
0 emotes	Nothing. You didn't buy anything.	Still nothing. Don't troll.
1 emote	350 RP	219 RP
2 emotes	700 RP	438 RP
3 emotes	1050 RP	657 RP
4 emotes	1400 RP	876 RP
If you own all four emotes, your Emote Starter Set price is 451 RP and we'll give you a refund of 876 RP Only the emotes included in the bundle (Clean, Does Not Compute, Despair, and Scout-Approved) will be discounted. Any emotes purchased after the bundle becomes available won't qualify for this discount. Trivia [ ] General Memes & Culture Pop Initially, emotes were only confined to social media sites before being introduced in-game in patch V6.23 with the All-Star 2016 event. In patch V7.20 the new emote system was introduced with permanent unlockable emotes. [1] In patch V8.12 in-game emotes were given several updates including reduced price and added visual and sound effects. During the initial launch, all Emotes were put on sale for 350 (where they originally had a cost of 450 ). In patch V8.12 , as mentioned prior, the price of emotes was permanently reduced from the initial 450 to 350 . The You Look Familiar emote showcases PBE Pyke clothing textures.
