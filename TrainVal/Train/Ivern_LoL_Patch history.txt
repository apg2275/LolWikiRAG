V6.21 General Bug Fix: Fixed a weird texture on the back of Daisy's delicious head with the Candy King Ivern skin. V6.20 Added Friend of the Forest – Innate Ivern cannot attack or damage non-epic monsters . Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2. 5 -second channel that, upon completion, places the monsters within a grove . Placing a grove costs health and mana , and cannot be cast if Ivern lacks the resources. The grove matures over 40 − 6 (based on level) seconds. When fully matured, Ivern can interact with the camp again to instantly free the monsters, sending them away while receiving their full gold and experience bounty . Smiting a camp within a grove will instantly free the monsters, regardless of its maturity or the monster's current health. If the camp's large monster has already been slain, Ivern will free the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the grove will instantly mature if the large monster is slain. Starting at level 5, freeing the Red Brambleback or Blue Sentinel leaves behind a sapling that can be picked up by an allied champion to gain the camp's buff, consuming it in the process. If at least one allied champion is nearby, Ivern can pick up the sapling to transfer it to the nearest one in range. If an ally kills either monster, they also leave behind a sapling that only Ivern can consume. Rootcaller – Q spell Ivern throws a vine in the target direction, dealing 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 70% AP) magic damage to the first enemy hit and rooting them for 1. 2 / 1. 4 / 1. 6 / 1. 8 / 2 seconds. Ivern and his allies can target enemies rooted by Rootcaller to dash to them, placing themselves at their attack range from the target. Cost: 60 mana Cooldown: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 Brushmaker – W spell Passive: While in brush, Ivern's basic attacks gain bonus range and deal bonus magic damage. These bonuses persist for 3 seconds after leaving brush. Active: Ivern grows a patch of brush at the target location, revealing the area within and around it for 3 seconds. Brushmaker spawns more brush if used near terrain or more brush. Brushmaker uses a stock system and Ivern can keep X in reserve. Cost: 30 mana Recharge: 40 / 36 / 32 / 28 / 24 seconds Cooldown: 0. 5 seconds Triggerseed – E spell Ivern gifts a seed to the target allied champion, himself or Daisy , shielding them for 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 80% AP) for 2 seconds. After the 2 seconds, Triggerseed bursts, dealing 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 70% AP) magic damage to all nearby enemies and slowing them by 70% for 3 seconds. Cost: 50 mana Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 Daisy! – R spell Ivern summons his sentinel friend Daisy , who remains on the field for 60 seconds as a controllable minion.
