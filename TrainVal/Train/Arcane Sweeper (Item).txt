Similar items Frost Queen's Claim Lightbringer Notes While the item got removed the game, it is still available while playing Featured Game Modes on the Crystal Scar map, such as Ascension or Definitely Not Dominion . It is still available there because when the item was removed from the Crystal Scar , it was due to the Dominion game mode being removed from the game, not because the item was actually removed.
