Snowbind deals area damage , and thus will trigger spell effects . Immolate deals default damage , and thus will not trigger spell effects . Immolate is an auto-targeted effect. Snowbind is not blocked by spell shield . The aura increases if the user increases in size , but is not impacted by their base size. The aura cannot get reduced below the base radii by negative size modifiers. Strategy The area of effect slow is useful for sticking onto and keeping targets close, especially on Tanks that lack consistent sticking power. Immolate's burning effect can help champions with otherwise poor wave or jungle clear to be able to efficiently clear minion waves and jungle camps. It also serves as a reliable source of damage in fights.
