At 4 Ferocity , his next basic ability consumes them all to become empowered with an additional effect and grant him an additional cast along with 30 / 40 / 50% (based on level) bonus movement speed for 1. 5 seconds. Reaching 4 Ferocity with Savagery or Bola Strike locks them from use for 0. 1 seconds before and after casting. All Ferocity is lost after 10 seconds of being out of combat . Innate: While in brush , Rengar gains Unseen Predator . Unseen Predator: Rengar's basic attacks have massively increased range and cause him to leap to the target's location, attacking the target upon arrival and landing closer than his normal melee range. This generates 1 Ferocity if Rengar had 0 Ferocity at one point. Unseen Predator lingers for 0. 35 seconds upon exiting brush but is lost immediately if Rengar casts Flash or Hexflash to do so. Rengar can cast any of his abilities during the dash. Innate - Bonetooth Necklace: Scoring a takedown against an enemy champion within 3 seconds of damaging them grants Rengar a Trophy , once per unique champion and up to 5. An additional Trophy is made available through the event The Hunt is On! with the Head of Kha'Zix . Trophies grant bonus attack damage equal to 1% − 36% (based on Trophies) bonus AD .

Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Counters Parries Grounded Knockdown Blocked See Notes Interrupted Rengar will not leap to targets already in his normal basic attack range. While grounded or rooted , Rengar loses the enhanced attack range from Unseen Predator . Rengar will only leap to a target if his basic attack timer has been refreshed (if not so he will not automatically attempt to path towards his target, despite them being within leap range). Only Flash and Hexflash instantly end Unseen Predator . Other effects (i.e Teleport ) will still cause the buff to linger upon leaving brush . Rengar can freely use any abilities , summoner spells , or item actives while leaping. Using a dash or blink ability will interrupt the leap. The leap's attack will have no effect if the target dies or becomes untargetable . Savagery's empowered attack will always be consumed. The attack from the leap will: Not go off if the dash was interrupted. Go off at the end of the dash even if its normal destination is obstructed by boundaries he cannot cross (e.g. terrain, The Hextech Ultimatum ). Go off regardless of distance the enemy travels away from Rengar's original location. Go off even if Rengar loses sight of the target. Rapid Firecannon's and Savagery's bonus ranges are lost after 0. 25 seconds upon gaining Unseen Predator , and are re-gained after 0. 25 seconds upon losing Unseen Predator .

Original View in 3D 880 21.08.2012 Rengar is a ferocious vastayan trophy hunter who lives for the thrill of tracking down and killing dangerous creatures. He scours the world for the most fearsome beasts he can find, especially seeking any trace of Kha’Zix, the void creature who scratched out his eye. Rengar stalks his prey neither for food nor glory, but for the sheer beauty of the pursuit.
