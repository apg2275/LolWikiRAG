Rift Scuttler Splash Normal Form Voidborn Form An elusive wandering pacifist. Killing this monster creates a Speed Shrine in the center of the river section she is killed on for 90 seconds. The shrine passively provides vision of the surrounding area, and allies walking on the shrine gain bonus movement speed .

The Rift Scuttler is a neutral monster on Summoner's Rift . There are two Rift Scuttlers on the map, one in the top half of the river and one in the bottom half of the river. The Rift Scuttler is unique amongst all monsters for two reasons: she will not retaliate against an attacker, instead attempting to flee directly away from them; and two, she continually moves along a fixed path in the river on the part of the map where she spawns. This makes Rift Scuttler the only (1) non-hostile and (2) autonomously moving monster on the map. Spawn [ ] Unlike other monsters, Rift Scuttlers spawn with one level below the average of all champions ' levels (capped at level 1). At initial spawn, Rift Scuttlers will spawn in the top and bottom river. Both must be killed before the respawn timer activates. Once both initial Rift Scuttlers are killed, only one Rift Scuttler can be on the map at any given time for the rest of the game. Respawn locations are randomly determined, but signaled ahead of time with a respawn marker. After the Baron Nashor spawns at 20:00 , all Rift Scuttlers become permanently corrupted by the Void , transforming into Voidborn with 30% increased health. Killing a Rift Scuttler in this form causes it to release an aura of void energy around itself over 1. 5 seconds, granting sight of the surrounding area as it travels and revealing enemies in its path. Enemy champions are revealed for 3 seconds, while non-champions are revealed for 12 seconds. The reveal duration refreshes if they remain in the area where the energy is still spreading. Revealed wards have their health reduced to 1. Once the energy has spread out completely, it continues to grant sight of the area for another 3 seconds. Gameplay [ ] When Rift Scuttler receives champion damage or is affected by an immobilize from any source, she will increase her base movement speed by 100 and attempt to run from the source for a period of time. Other sources of damage will not cause her to switch the source she is fleeing from. If she runs to the very end of the river, she will dash back down to the center and resume fleeing. The first Rift Scuttlers spawned have 35% reduced health, 80% reduced experience and -13% size . Rift Scuttler has several unique interactions with crowd control : She gains 100% slow resist while not fleeing. She has -100% Tenacity ; crowd control effects that are affected by Tenacity last twice as long against her. Her dash can be knocked down and she won't commence it while rooted or grounded . Speed Shrine [ ] Speed Shrine Edit Description Grants sight over the area surrounding the shrine. Moving within the area grants 30% bonus movement speed for 1. 5 seconds. Stats Duration 90 Source Rift Scuttler Affect Team When the Rift Scuttler is killed, she will head towards the front of the entrance to the pit of Baron Nashor or Dragon (depending on the part of the map) and will scuttle down the river, spawning an untargetable 500 -radius Speed Shrine with her antennae for 90 seconds. The shrine grants a 525 sight radius of the area to the killer's team and a brief movement speed boost to champions that cross it. After the duration, the shrine will vanish and Rift Scuttler will respawn at her location after her respawn timer has elapsed. Notes [ ] Despite having attack damage and attack speed , Rift Scuttler is physically incapable of attacking a target, even when taunted . When taunted, she will get locked in place for the duration. If the Rift Scuttler is forcibly taken out of the river (possible through Regurgitate , Force of Will , etc.), she will continuously dash to return to the river she was in. It is possible for Rift Scuttler to become stuck in Dragon or Baron Nashor's pit, as she will attempt to run through the inner walls in an attempt to return to the river. This can be achieved more easily by displacing or otherwise herding her towards the pit, such as with Sion's Roar of the Slayer . If a Honeyfruit drops its fruits near a Rift Scuttler , she will dash to the closest fruit and eat it, blocking the fruit for up to 10 seconds, after which the fruit disappears. Attacking the Rift Scuttler while she's eating a fruit will make her run away, making the fruit available again. Ivern is unable to attack a Rift Scuttler , so freeing it quickly before the 10 seconds is over is the only way to save the fruit from being eaten. The reduced size of the first Rift Scuttler spawn is inherited by the character that moves to become the speed shrine ward. PENDING FOR TEST: The speed shrine effect radius however is still indifferent to the gameplay radius of the character that forms it. Trivia [ ] The Rift Scuttler is female. [1] If Tahm Kench dances near Rift Scuttler , she will stop scuttling to dance alongside him. [2] The dance will be interrupted if Tahm Kench interrupts his own with a non-emote input (including commands that do not interrupt the dance animation such as 'Stop' and 'Halt'), but will not if he is no longer nearby, for instance if he makes the Scuttler dance while recalling to base. (bug) The icon for Gravity Boots is a purple recolor of that for the Speed Shrine buff. Patch History [ ] V14.2 Bug Fix: Camp respawn timer has been corrected to 3:30 from 3:32.
