Edit Twin Bite Twin Bite COOLDOWN : 8 / 7. 5 / 7 / 6. 5 / 6 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 325 / 250 ANGLE: 180 ° Active: Shyvana empowers her next basic attack within 6 seconds to gain 25 bonus range , deal 100% AD (+ 50% AP) physical damage , and cause her to strike again after 0. 25 seconds to deal bonus physical damage . The second strike applies on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectiveness and is affected by critical strike modifiers. Bonus Physical Damage: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100% AD (+ 25% AP) After consuming the empowered attack, her next two basic attacks within 5 seconds gain bonus attack speed Bonus Attack Speed: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% Basic attacks reduce Twin Bite's current cooldown by 0. 5 seconds on-hit . Dragon Form Bonus: Shyvana attacks enemies in a cone in front of her and applies the second strike to enemies surrounding the primary target. Both the attack and the strike occur at the same time and each of them apply Twin Bite's respective effects to all targets hit, with the exception of the second strike not applying on-attack effects and being unable to critically strike . The attack is affected by critical strike modifiers, applies on-hit effects to enemies hit, and triggers on-attack effects against only the primary target. Additionally, Twin Bite's empowered attack has an uncancellable windup . Twin Bite resets Shyvana's basic attack timer. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Blocked Blocked Dragon Form's Twin Bite cannot apply Tiamat's Cleave on each target hit because of Cleave's internal 0. 05 seconds interval during which it cannot be applied on a different target. Dragon Form's Twin Bite only applies the attack to enemies that would be hit by the second strike. In Dragon Form , Both strikes belong to the same cast instance . In Human Form , they don't. Since the second strike applies after the ability goes on cooldown, it will reduce its own cooldown. Unlike most on-hit effects, the one reducing the cooldown of Twin Bite also triggers against structures . In Dragon Form , Twin Bite consumes an additional stack of Hail of Blades .

In Dragon Form , the fiery explosion applies area damage and the burning scorch deals persistent area damage to all enemies within the area of effect. In Dragon Form , both areas of effect will be centered on the first champion struck, not at the location the missile collided with them. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

For all associated collection items, see Shyvana (Collection) . Original View in 3D 790 01.11.2011 Shyvana is a creature with the magic of a rune shard burning within her heart. Though she often appears humanoid, she can take her true form as a fearsome dragon, incinerating her foes with fiery breath. Having saved the life of the crown prince Jarvan IV, Shyvana now serves uneasily in his royal guard, struggling to find acceptance among the suspicious people of Demacia.

Shyvana herself cares little about their opinions, preferring instead to channel her rage into her true form—a massive, fire-breathing dragon… that proves the hunters' point. Karen Strassman Feihong Chen Prehistoric Hunters Loot eligible Darkflame View in 3D 975 28.05.2012 With her humanity burned away by the Darkflame, Shvyana wreaks havoc upon the battlefield. It is said that any enemy touched by her flame will have their very soul incinerated by its dark magics. Karen Strassman Unknown artist Legacy Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Ice Drake View in 3D 975 29.04.2013 From the desolate reaches of the North, a dormant drake lay in rest. Upon Shyvana's arrival this behemoth awakened from its slumber and imbued her with the power of the frozen wastes. Now she stalks the tundra, searching for any foolish enough to cross her path.

A transfer pilot from a different (but just as hyperbolically named) defense force, she does sometimes find herself at odds with her allies as much as her enemies—and periodically questions if the ten percent salary bonus was actually worth it. Karen Strassman Xu 'Crow God' Cheng Super Galaxy Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Ruined View in 3D 1350 21.01.2021 Shyvana's ruination brings a newfound darkness, as well as clarity. Turning swiftly against Demacia for its persecution of magic, and sinking into her more draconic emotions, she appears as an avenging beast of old, ready to topple Demacia for its ignorance.

Transforming into a human, she enjoyed the challenge this new form would bring. Unlike Soraka, Shyvana has no doubt about who she is: a protector of the strongest school of immortality.

Cassiopeia , Fiora and Zyra are also voiced by the same voice actress. Shyvana's dance references RIVER by AKB48 . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Her name derives from Irish Gaelic Siobhán [ˈʃɪwaːn̪ˠ], Anglicized as Shevaun or Shivaun : Dragon's Descent is the only non-toggle ability in-game without a cooldown. Shyvana's resource was misnamed 'Dragon's Blood' in her champion preview. Shyvana's dragon form resembles a wyvern . Shyvana, Elise , Gnar , Nidalee , and Swain are the only champions with a transformation ability. Shyvana was the first champion since Kog'Maw to not feature a League Judgement after they were discontinued (except Varus ).
