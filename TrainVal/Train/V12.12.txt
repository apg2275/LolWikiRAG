Essence Emporium The Essence Emporium returns from June 28, 2022 to July 12, 2022. Head to the store to use Blue Essence to nab chromas, ward skins, emotes, icons, and more, including Emporium exclusives like the URFWick skin. After this run, the Essence Emporium is going on hiatus while we rebuild it. Right now, running the Emporium is so inefficient it causes delays and feature cuts in other projects like events and missions. Beyond making the Emporium more efficient to run, we're also exploring navigation and usability improvements for when (not if) it returns. Be sure to spend all your Blue Essence during this Emporium. To make up for this hiatus, we're shifting the three Gemstone icon bundles into a chain of three missions (matchmade SR or ARAM). This will be free for all players, granting 10 Mythic Essence each for a total of 30.
