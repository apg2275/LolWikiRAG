Thirsting Slash deals area damage , and thus will trigger spell effects . Thirsting Slash is blocked by spell shield . Thirsting Slash is an auto-targeted effect. Thirsting Slash's cast breaks stealth . Thirsting Slash has a brief cast time equal to 100% of the caster's attack windup time. Therefore the cast time both scales with attack speed and depends on the champion that casts it. Thirsting Slash calculates its heal sequentially; the heal will be calculated in order of each enemy champion hit rather than all at once. Thirsting Slash's damage is dealt prior to its healing, thus healing received based on damage dealt, such as by vamp effects, will take effect before the active effect's heal. Thirsting Slash also grants healing per struck clone . Thirsting Slash will grant the healing even if it doesn't deal damage to the enemy champion struck. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Health changed to 400. Heal per champion hit changed to 10% missing health . New Effect: Thirsting Slash's damage now scales with 105% AP . New Effect: Thirsting Slash's heal now scales with 12% AP per champion hit. Mythic passive bonus health changed to 50. Trivia In the set of V11.3 changes that were patched onto VPBE , Thirsting Slash's missing health percentage heal was erroneously changed to 80% (0.8), instead of 8% (0.08). This would later be corrected only after the following weekend. Coincidentally, ARURF was enabled on PBE, where players can use items and abilities with practically no costs or cooldowns. Goredrinker was frequently exploited by players that rolled champions such as Tanks and Fighters : classes that favor the item due to their close-quarters combat and preference for health & sustain.
