Teemo will maintain stealth so long as he remains idle and is not displaced . While in brush , Teemo gains the stealth even while moving and can move without breaking stealth. Innate - Element of Surprise: When Teemo breaks the stealth, he gains 20 / 40 / 60 / 80% (based on level) bonus attack speed for 5 seconds.

Charm , Flee , and Taunt will force him out of stealth . If Teemo is in a brush while stealthed, only Taunt will break it. Guerilla Warfare's stealth is special-cased to be interrupted whenever Teemo moves from his location by any means (whether by dashing , blinking , being displaced , or simply moving), thus, performing actions that do not normally break stealth which also involve movement will cause the invisibility to break. Notably, Flash and Teleport . If Teemo is in a brush the aforementioned spells do not end the stealth so long as his exact destination is still inside brush. Starting Teleport's channel will not break Guerilla Warfare , only the blink upon completing the channel will (with the exception stated above). Guerilla Warfare will not activate while Recalling .

If Teemo dies before Noxious Trap bounces on another, the trap will disappear. Rift Scuttler will not trigger Noxious Trap's explosion if it is not being attacked. Enemies who step on multiple Noxious Traps will only refresh the duration of the damage over time and slow. Noxious Trap's damage is determined when it detonates and not when planted, meaning if Teemo's ability power changes, the scaling is also altered to affect the active damage of all Noxious Traps so long as they do not explode. Spell shield will prevent the damage over time and slow for all units but will not prevent the detonation itself.

Original View in 3D 585 21.02.2009 Undeterred by even the most dangerous and threatening of obstacles, Teemo scouts the world with boundless enthusiasm and a cheerful spirit.

[2] Teemo's dance references Badgers by Weebl . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Teemo features in the Season 3 mastery Scout 's icon. Teemo, Akshan , and Evelynn are the only champions who can be permanently stealthed (through Guerrilla Warfare , Going Rogue , and Demon Shade respectively). Fiora draws Teemo's face in the air in her joke emote. Teemo's blowgun can be seen inside a weapons cabinet in the game's Mac Version trailer. Teemo being the smallest champion in-game has led to the creation of a measurement unit named after him (used to calculate ranges). Despite the measurement unit, Teemo's actual size is 110 units in diameter - "For another point of reference, Teemo has a radius of 55 units and his size is approximately 9,503 units" . In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, the following changes regarding Teemo were jokingly listed: Cuteness increased by 10%. Teemo may no longer be the target of hostile attacks or abilities. Over the years, player frustration from Teemo's abilities and backstory have led to meme and perception that he is an evil individual akin to a demonic figure (specifically Satan ) Riot Games later officially honored this with the release of Little Devil Teemo . Omega Squad Teemo is voiced by a new actor because the previous one no longer works for Riot Games. Teemo is an anagram for the word emote, befitting his recognizable and iconic face which has led to him being an unofficial mascot of sorts. On Teemo's day, February 21, RiotGames Twitter share Teemo facts throughout the day.
