For information about the series of alternate future/universe pop music skins , see K/DA . The Kill to Death ratio , or KDR , is simply a player's number of kills divided by the number of deaths . The KDR is part of a series of performance statistics , which may assess a player's performance and/or their champion's approximate level of power, compared to other players in the game. When referring to ranked modes over an accrued number of games, they may also be used to compare a player's performance with other players' in the same skill bracket. These performance statistics are not explicitly tracked in-game; they are calculated. Ratios here are also mathematically undefined for zero deaths. To solve this, by convention either the death count is raised to 1 (i.e. the D {\textstyle D} in the formulae is replaced with max ( D , 1 ) {\textstyle \max(D, 1)} ), or "zero deaths" is simply considered a "perfect" score. Contents 1 Kill Ratios 2 Dominance Statistics 3 Participation Statistics 4 Example Scores Kill Ratios [ ] The Kill-Death ratio [ KDR ] is defined as the ratio of kills over deaths: KD = K D {\displaystyle 
\color{White}
{\rm \textbf{KD}} = \frac{K}{D}
} If its value is higher than 1, the ratio is considered positive. The higher it is from 1, the better the player's performance. If its value is lower than 1 , the ratio is considered negative. The lower it is from 1, the worse a player's performance. The KDR is usually measured on carry roles, for which it is important to maximize kill rewards while minimizing deaths in order to avoid giving enemy carries opportunities and bounties. A variant is the Kill-Death-Assist ratio [ KDA ], which is the ratio of the sum of kills and assists, over deaths: KDA = K + A D {\displaystyle 
\color{White}
{\rm \textbf{KDA}} = \frac{K+A}{D}
} The KDA is usually preferred over the KDR because it is inclusive of all roles, since they naturally have major variances in their kill participation without it meaning they are weaker, but it also places importance on minimizing deaths. Dominance Statistics [ ] The dominance factor [ DF ] is a point sum, where each kill progresses the sum by 2, each assist progresses the sum by 1, and each death regresses the sum by 3. Like the previous kill ratios, minimizing deaths is important, but this statistic also differentiates carries and non-carries: DF = 2 ⋅ K + A − 3 ⋅ D {\displaystyle 
\color{White}
{\rm \textbf{DF}} = 2 \cdot K + A - 3 \cdot D
} As such, dominance statistics assume carries to be the "dominant" players. A higher value compared to an enemy (carry) counterpart implies a greater influence on the game, and may decide the winning team. A dominance ratio [ DR ] in this style would result in the same assessment, but as a ratio that simply has different values instead. DR = 2 ⋅ K + A 3 ⋅ D {\displaystyle 
\color{White}
{\rm \textbf{DR}} = \frac{2\cdot K+A}{3\cdot D}} When comparing to other players, ratios like the KD , KDA , and DR are not affected by the player's activity level, while summed point systems like DF are. Participation Statistics [ ] The Kill Participation ratio [ KP ] measures a player's involvement in fights or duels across a given game, and is defined as the percentage ratio of the sum of kills and assists, over the team score. The team score is the total number of a team's total kills (T), also shown at the top HUD. KP = K + A T ⋅ 100 % {\displaystyle 
\color{White}
{\rm \textbf{KP}} = \frac{K+A}{T}\cdot 100\%} The Position Proximity ratio [ PP ] measures how much assistance a laner gets from a roaming role, and is defined as the percentage ratio of game time that the role is within a certain, assumed radius of (other) lanes and not farming , over the total game time. Proximity measures the amount of assistance, whether in actual fights or in pressure, that laners and especially carry laners may get from that role in order to succeed. Note that this score applies to the laner receiving the assistance, not the one offering it. PP = G a m e T i m e c l o s e t o o t h e r l a n e s T o t a l G a m e T i m e ⋅ 100 % {\displaystyle 
\color{White}
{\rm \textbf{PP}} = \frac{{\rm Game\ Time\ close\ to\ other\ lanes}}{{\rm Total\ Game\ Time}}\cdot 100\%} (Both values are in seconds) Most commonly, proximity specifically refers to the role that innately assumes influence on all lanes, meaning the jungler , in which case it is called Jungle Proximity ratio [ JP ] and is the most common among all position proximity ratios. Example Scores [ ] The following table provides examples for the various performance statistics of 3 players on a team: Player K D A KD KDA DF DR P1 6 2 5 3 5.5 11 2.83 P2 2 6 8 0.33 1.67 -6 0.67 P3 4 2 17 2 10.5 19 1.67
