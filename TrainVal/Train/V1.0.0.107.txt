Desperada Cassiopeia Siren Cassiopeia Santa Gragas Reindeer Kog'Maw Silent Night Sona Nutcracko Re-Gifted Amumu Ragdoll Poppy Candy Cane Miss Fortune Snowdown Showdown The Winter Map is back for the Showdown! Eggnog Health Potion and Eggnog Mana Potion to temporarily replace their regular counterparts . Minions with elf and reindeer hats. Festive skins. Festive Tier 3 runes. Festive PVP.net loading page. Winter Map is back, temporarily replacing Autumn Map. PVP.net V1.25.93 Improved Leaver Buster - PVP.net will now automatically ban leavers. This works similar to a 'driving points" system for driver's licenses. You gain 'leave points' by leaving games, and if you have enough leave points, you will be suspended or banned. You lose 'leave points' by having good behavior – by completing your games, and not leaving over a long period of time. Mastery saving has been improved: Respeccing your masteries no longer saves an empty mastery page to the server. This means you'll never accidentally enter the game with no masteries. You can now remove saved mastery points individually without having to return all your points. When you have unsaved changes in your rune page or mastery page, you will now be prompted to save when navigating away. Lowered the volume level of audio in PVP.net at all slider positions. You may want to adjust the audio levels in PVP.net as a result. Fixed a bug where viewing another users Champions would display your own Champions instead. This option is now greyed out when viewing another users profile. Fixed a bug where the "Play Again" button would not work at the End of Game screen for arranged teams. Fixed a bug where you could not select the "Random" marker in Champion Selection. Fixed a bug where PVP.net would crash at certain resolutions.
