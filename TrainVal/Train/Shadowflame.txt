Cinderbloom does not apply to damage dealt against structures . Cinderbloom interacts with critical damage modifiers by only applying them to its bonus damage. This means that Infinity Edge's critical strike damage stat of +40% is applied only to the bonus damage of Cinderbloom and not the entire damage instance.
