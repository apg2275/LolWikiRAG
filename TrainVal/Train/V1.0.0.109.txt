League of Legends V1.0.0.109 Champions Renekton, the Butcher of the Sands Renekton uses a new resource system called Fury. Renekton gains Fury by attacking or dealing damage with spells. When he has gathered enough Fury, the resource will be expended to empower his skills with bonus effects. Reign of Anger (Innate): Renekton gains 5 Fury per autoattack. Having sufficient fury empowers Renekton’s abilities with bonus effects, but this drains Fury. Out of combat, Renekton loses 5 Fury per second. Cull the Meek : Renekton swings his blade, dealing damage to nearby enemies and healing for a portion of the damage dealt. Fury Bonus : Heal amount raised dramatically. Ruthless Predator : Renekton's next attack swings twice, dealing damage, plus a large portion of his base damage, stunning his target briefly and applying on-hit effects each time. Fury Bonus : Renekton's next attack swings three times, dealing a huge portion of his weapon damage, stunning his target greatly and applying on-hits each time. Slice : Renekton dashes forward, dealing physical damage to targets along the way. If he hits a target, he can use Dice for a brief period of time for the same effect. Fury Bonus : Renekton deals 50% increased damage and reduces the armor of units hit. Dominus (Ultimate): Renekton empowers himself with dark energy, gaining size and bonus health. He deals periodic damage to enemies around him and rapidly gains Fury. Caitlyn Piltover Peacemaker Base damage changed to 20 / 65 / 110 / 155 / 200 from 40 / 70 / 100 / 130 / 160.

You will now get fewer ‘lucky’ or ‘unlucky’ streaks where you get no critical hits/dodges in a row, or a lot of them in a row. Your average chance to get a crit is the same as before though – if you have a 50% crit rate, and you make 100 attacks, you’ll still crit about 50 times. Baron Nashor 's Wrath of the Ancients spell no longer targets stealthed units. Jungle monsters that previously had negative magic resistance now have magic resistance of zero.
