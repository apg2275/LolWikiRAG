Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2. 5 second channel that will plant a grove upon the camp. Placing a grove costs 94. 5 − 0. 14 (based on level) health and 90 − 0. 37 (based on level) mana . The channel cannot be cancelled in the first 0. 15 seconds and in the last 0. 5 seconds. Ivern cannot place a grove while he is unable to cast abilities. The grove matures over 40 − 1 (based on level) seconds. When fully matured, Ivern can target the camp again to free it after a 0. 5 -second cast time , clearing the camp and receiving the full gold and full experience bounties . Using Smite on a monster within the grove will instantly free the camp regardless of maturity. If the camp's large monster has already been slain prior to planting a grove , Ivern will free the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the grove will instantly mature if the large monster is slain. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Counters Disruption Interrupted Freeing a Krugs camp will only give the gold and experience of 1 Ancient Krug , 2 Krugs , and 3 Mini Krugs , for a total of 95 − 128. 25 (based on monster's level) experience and 85 . The entire Krugs camp is usually a total of 1 Ancient Krug , 3 Krugs , and 6 Mini Krugs , for a total of 153 − 206. 55 (based on monster's level) and 131 . Ivern must be within 275 units of the large monster of the targeted camp to start channeling or collect a grove . The large monsters also must be visible . If Ivern cannot afford the cost to place a grove, Friend of the Forest is placed on a cooldown equal to the number of seconds it takes for his health regeneration and/or mana regeneration to restore him to the amount of health and/or mana needed to afford the cost. The cooldown will update based on Ivern's current health and mana regeneration, as well as his current health and mana. Friend of the Forest can be used while Ivern or the camp is in combat and, once the grove is placed, Smite can be used to instantly claim the camp. Interrupting Ivern's channel is the only way to contest jungle camps, short of killing the camp during the channel time. Saplings cannot be gathered by allied champions in a zombie state nor allied clones . Saplings can be gathered while untargetable . Allied clones killing buff monsters will also cause a sapling to be spawned. Freeing a grove causes the monsters within the camp to be dealt 5000 true damage in the internalraw damage source type by Ivern , despite his inability to damage them. Friend of the Forest will leave Ivern at 1 health if cast with exactly the required amount. Friend of the Forest cannot be cast with less, unlike other abilities with health costs. The following table refers for interactions while Ivern is channeling : Ivern is unable to act during the first 0. 15 and last 0. 5 seconds of the channel.

Recast: Ivern dashes to the rooted target. Hitting a non-epic monster reduces Rootcaller's cooldown by 50%.

Daisy dashes to rooted minions. Rootcaller will hit monsters but does not deal damage to them unless they were an epic monster. Ivern's pull/attack range is determined when he dashes to the target - not from when he initially casts Rootcaller and throws the vine. Ivern is not able to dash to the target unless they are within approximately 1200 range. PENDING FOR TEST: : This also counts for allies. Rootcaller cannot be used to dash while grounded or rooted . This applies to Ivern and his allies. Rootcaller's dash does not follow targets, their position at the time of starting the dash is the location Ivern and his allies will stop from. Ivern and his teammates cannot dash to a target if the root was not applied to them. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds.

The damage of Triggerseed is attributed to the champion the shield was cast on. If cast on Daisy , the damage is attributed to Ivern . The slow debuff is always attributed to Ivern . Therefore, placing Triggerseed on allied champions: grants them credit for all kills on enemy units that it causes. triggers turret aggro on them if it deals damage to an enemy champion. triggers their spell effects instead of Ivern's . benefits from their magic penetration stat. Ivern's player can appreciate the damage Triggerseed from an ally deals via a yellow damage number intended to reflect the damage dealt. This yellow damage number wrongfully uses Ivern's magic penetration stat to calculate the expected damage dealt, instead of reflecting the actual damage dealt.

On V9.20 , Ivern became the first champion to have its range type changed, from Melee to Ranged . If Ivern summons Daisy and then dances, she will also dance. Daisy's animations were reused from the Blue Sentinel's . Because of this, she shared its dance, which references Open the Door by Im Chang-jung . Before the rework of the Rift Herald in patch V7.9 , she also shared this dance with her. The Raptor camp features in the icon of his Friend of the Forest ability.
