Original View in 3D 585 01.09.2009 Armed with the power of Runeterra’s gales, Janna is a mysterious, elemental wind spirit who protects the dispossessed of Zaun. Some believe she was brought into existence by the pleas of Runeterra’s sailors who prayed for fair winds as they navigated treacherous waters and braved rough tempests. Her favor and protection has since been called into the depths of Zaun, where Janna has become a beacon of hope to those in need. No one knows where or when she will appear, but more often than not, she’s come to help.

Janna's long exposure to such raw materials famously granted her the power of limited flight, and the ability to control the wind.

Might be time to put her meteorology degree to good use, and… fight the sky!

While she rarely offers information about her mysterious past, her poise and quiet strength are deeply admired by her Star Guardian teammates. Erin Fitzgerald Esben Lash Rasmussen Star Guardian Season 1 Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Sacred Sword View in 3D 1350 27.09.2017 Janna is the guardian of an ancient sword made of the purest jade, hidden at the bottom of a silent lake.

But without a champion in the Coronation, the magic that brings long-life to Aurai's reclusive population will fail, and so Janna descends for yet another showcase exhibition of her power. Anything to protect her people. Erin Fitzgerald West Studio Battle Queens Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Battle Queen Janna Chromas Amethyst Aquamarine Catseye Coronation Obsidian Pearl Peridot Ruby Crystal Rose View in 3D 1350 10.02.2022 The desire for peace brought about more than just a yearly festival. Born from this universal wish was Janna, a spirit whose magic hangs like a wreath over the night. Though she's regarded by most as a legend, guests sometimes say they see a beautiful woman float by. Maybe it's a trick of the crystal rose's light...

Perhaps it's because she looks so human that most forget the gusts of “wind“ she commands are actually a fleet of nanobots connected directly to both the X09-Zephyr as well as her central processing core.

Heavenscale View in 3D 1350 07.02.2024 Janna is the most skilled dragon in the kingdom at sorcery (save for the king himself, perhaps), whipping up winds and steering the clouds. The prince asked if she might take him on as a pupil, and Janna happily accepted; but she is looking forward to showing him more whimsical uses of their power. After all, they have a festival to attend. Erin Fitzgerald Julia Yurtsev Heavenscale Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Heavenscale Janna Chromas Amethyst Catseye Emerald Lustrous Obsidian Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Janna is voiced by Erin Fitzgerald . [2] Sona , DJ Sona and PsyOps Sona are also voiced by the same voice actress. During development she was called AirAvatar , which then turned into her title 'The Avatar of Air' before getting changed to 'The Storm's Fury'. Some localizations retain it (French: L'avatar De L'air ). Janna's original lore might have been inspired by Storm from X-Men . She herself might have been based on Barbariccia from Final Fantasy IV . Janna is the only champion able to shield turrets ( Eye of the Storm ). Turrets can help her score kills indirectly by doing this. Janna's dance references DanceStudio's Jazz-Funk choreography. A side-by-side comparison can be seen here.
