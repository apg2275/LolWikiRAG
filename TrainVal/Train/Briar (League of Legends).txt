It picks its dash destination ~100 units in front of enemy targets, 75 units in front enemy targets when already very close to them, 75 units in front of of allied targets. If already within 75 units of her target, she dashes to her current location, which takes 0 time but still triggers dash effects such as Sudden Impact . It does not force the target's resistance values to update immediately outside of the natural stat update cycle, which means it will typically still be mitigated by the unreduced magic resistance value.

The mark disrupts their ongoing channels , and also reveals them until the effects of Certain Death are removed. If a target is hit, Briar cleanses herself from all crowd control and destroys her pillory over a cast time, afterwards dashing to them with displacement immunity . Upon arrival, she creates an explosion around the marked target that deals magic damage to them and nearby enemies and fears all non-marked targets for 1. 5 seconds, during which they are slowed by 35%.

If that target becomes invalid, she will shift back to her normal targeting priority until the marked target can be attacked again. Hematomania lasts until the marked target dies. Casting Chilling Scream ends Hematomania early. Head Rush's cast does not shift her targeting priority during Hematomania. Link ▶️ Activation alert. Link ▶️ " FOUND YOU!! " Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Grounded Blocked Blocked Disabled Knockdown Not Interrupted Briar will track the target if they change locations. Briar lands 100 units in front of her target at the end of the dash. Briar will not initiate the second cast if she is being suppressed or is under resurrection . Since Certain Death cleanses herself from all crowd control when the first cast hits, she will be able to start the second cast due to removing the suppression effect. Briar will still dash to the target even if they die before she reaches them. Briar gains the displacement immunity upon starting the second cast time. Briar will place herself onto the ground and interrupts displacements affecting her upon starting the second cast time. Hematomania's targeting priorities differ slightly from that of Blood Frenzy's : She will prioritize the marked target regardless of range and over all other units as long as it can be attacked. If the marked target is not available, then she shifts her priority to the nearest other champion, then large monster or minion, and then any other unit. If neither the marked target is valid or any other valid targets are close nearby, then she will prioritize targeting the nearest other champion, then large monster or minion, and then any other unit within a global radius. Starting the second cast interrupts any spells that Briar is channeling. The mark will expire if Hematomania's buff is dispelled. Casting Blood Frenzy during Hematomania will not grant any additional bonuses nor will it override Hematomania's effects. Gaining Hematomania while Blood Frenzy is active will override the previous buff. The disrupt is 'wrapped' into a status effect that says the target is Silenced for 0. 3 seconds, but it does not actually silence . It however makes sure that the disrupt is prevented by immunity to silences . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.

Original View in 3D 975 13.09.2023 A failed experiment by the Black Rose, Briar's uncontrollable bloodlust required a special pillory to focus her frenzied mind. After years of confinement, this living weapon broke free from her restraints and unleashed herself into the world. Now she's controlled by no one—following only her hunger for knowledge and blood—and relishes the opportunities to let loose, even if reining back the frenzy isn't easy. Julie Nathanson Horace 'Hozure' Hsu Loot eligible Street Demons View in 3D 1350 13.09.2023 Whether you see her violently in-your-face tags that inspire audiences to get WILD, or her more relaxed art rife with cheeky humor, Briar's work makes an impression. As a jiangshi, she feeds off of the energy her art creates, so which style she uses really just depends on how hungry Briar is.
