Promoting a caster minion will give it the least bonus stats of the three, but because it has the highest range, it is best used to offer more aggro damage if the enemy attacks its ally. Promoting a siege minion will make it really tanky, and slightly increase his DPS, making it a tanky self-pushing minion. Due to the difficulty of destroying the siege minion and the heavy attack damage it brings, it can potentially net last hits without even thinking about it as well and last a long time causing it to inevitably reach the enemy turret if left unhindered.
