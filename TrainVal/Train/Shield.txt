This distinction separates the amount from calculation by health based effects . They may persist on the recipient to absorb a set amount of damage (shield strength) and/or until the duration runs out (shield duration). When shielded from multiple sources, damage taken is mitigated by the shield that will expire the soonest, with the exceptions of Adaptive Defenses and Black Shield , which take priority over all other shields. The unit's resistances ( armor and magic resistance ) will still mitigate the damage before being absorbed by shielding . The shield's strength can be increased by heal and shield power . Shield types [ ] An active shield is indicated on the champion's overhead health bar in a distinct color. Normal shields: They absorb all types of damage (physical, magic and true), and appear greyish-white . Magic shields: They only absorb magic damage , and appear purple . Physical shields: They only absorb physical damage , and appear orange .
