Divine Sunderer's Spellblade heal is granted before the application of Grievous Wounds by Bramble Vest's and Thornmail's Thorns . This is due to the healing reduction being applied on-hit , whereas the heal is granted before that event. Spellblade deals proc damage , and thus will not trigger spell effects . Spellblade is not blocked by spell shield if applied by a basic attack. It is blocked if the effect is applied by an ability that triggers on-hit effects. Spellblade can be blocked (negates the damage, consumes the effect, and places it on cooldown) and dodged (prevents the effect from triggering altogether). Block will prevent Essence Reaver's mana restore. Spellblade is not affected by critical strike modifiers. Spellblade's bonus damage benefits from life steal , omnivamp , and physical vamp (this one excludes Lich Bane ) but not spell vamp . Spellblade's cooldown starts after the enhanced attack is consumed and consecutive ability casts refresh the duration of the enhanced attack. Spellblade will trigger against structures .
