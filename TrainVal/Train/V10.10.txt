Player Behavior We told players about our short and long-term plans to address deliberate game-ruining behavior. Our proposed plans aren't meant to target those who are genuinely having a bad game, but those who decide that the game is over on their own and then spend their time trolling others instead of trying to play their best. The first of our short-term plans is to adjust our Reporting and Punishment system. In 10.10, you should start to see more frequent "Instant Feedback" reports for disruptive behavior as we work on tweaking our behavioral systems.
