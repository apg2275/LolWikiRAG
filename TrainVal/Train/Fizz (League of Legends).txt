Urchin Strike only damages targets if within 200 units of their original location upon completion of the dash. Fizz will be automatically ordered to basic attack the target after Urchin Strike . Urchin Strike does not deal damage if the target is untargetable . Life steal applies only on the physical damage component. Spell vamp applies to both the physical damage and bonus magic damage.

Seastone Trident's interactions with dodging , blocking , and blinding effects. The passive bonus damage gets negated by dodging or blocking the attack, or if Fizz is blinded . The active: If the attacked enemy is dodging or if Fizz is blinded , the empowered attack won't deal any damage, but the empowered attack won't be consumed. If the attacked enemy is blocking , the empowered attack won't deal any damage despite being consumed. But the attack will apply the passive bonus damage of Seastone Trident . The empowered attack will trigger against structures . The damage over time effect is not applied to inhibitors . Edit Playful Playful COST: 75 / 80 / 85 / 90 / 95 Mana COOLDOWN : 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 / 8 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 400 EFFECT RADIUS: 375 Active: Fizz dashes to the target location while becoming untargetable , balancing on his trident for 0. 75 seconds, during which he can cast Trickster after 0. 15 seconds into the duration. He then begins to hop off of his trident over 0. 5 seconds, afterwards becoming targetable and landing to create a splash that deals magic damage to nearby enemies and slows them for 2 seconds. Magic Damage: 80 / 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 (+ 90% AP) Slow: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% While hopping off of the trident, Fizz may input movement commands to direct his landing. Playful will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Edit Trickster Trickster TARGET RANGE: 300 EFFECT RADIUS: 225 Active: Fizz dashes to the target location, hopping down and splashing onto the ground prematurely upon arrival to deal the same damage in a smaller radius but not applying the slow. Trickster will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Playful Details Trickster Details Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled See Notes Notes Playful counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Detonating the ability early for Trickster does not. Playful cannot be used for approximately 0. 5 seconds after using Urchin Strike . Flash can be used while hopping off the trident but not while balanced on it. If the first dash is interrupted, Fizz initiates the hop immediately, and if the second one is, the splash will not occur. In either cases, Fizz loses the untargetability. If Playful is cast while under the effect of a move block, Fizz will not become untargetable and will initiate the hop instantly. (bug) If Trickster is cast, the splash will not occur. (bug) There is a minimum dash distance of 25 units for Playful . If Fizz casts Playful on top of himself after being teleported (e.g. Flash , Recall ), the minimum dash distance will not apply. (bug) The distance covered during Playful's directed splash is equal to half of Fizz's movement speed. If Fizz enters stasis during either Playful or Trickster , the splash occurs after the stasis ends. Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Notes Trickster does not count as an ability activation. Both Playful's and Trickster's dashes may be directed separately. Trickster has a minimum dash distance of 75 units. Flash cannot be used during the dash. The splash occurs immediately if Fizz encounters terrain that cannot be dashed through (he has to be particularly close to the wall). Edit Chum the Waters Chum the Waters COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 100 / 85 / 70 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1300 SPEED: 1300 Active: Fizz throws down a lure at the target location that attracts a shark, granting sight of the area before it emerges to chomp at the lure after 2 seconds, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies, knocking them back , though not through terrain, and slowing them for 2 seconds. The further the lure travels in its initial flight, the larger the shark that is attracted; increasing Chum the Waters' damage, slow, eruption radius and knock back distance. Guppy (<455): 40% slow, 200 eruption radius and 150 unit knock back distance. Guppy Damage: 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 80% AP) Chomper (455-910): 60% slow, 325 eruption radius and 250 unit knock back distance. Chomper Damage: 225 / 325 / 425 (+ 100% AP) Gigalodon (>910): 80% slow, 450 eruption radius and 350 unit knock back distance. Gigalodon Damage: 300 / 400 / 500 (+ 120% AP) Enemy champions can intercept the lure while it is in flight, which attaches to them upon contact and causes the shark to emerge at their position after the same delay. The lure's holder is slowed and revealed for the duration and afterwards is impacted by the eruption but is knocked up for 1 second instead of knocked back. Chum the Waters will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Link ▶️ "Feeding time!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes See Notes Chum the Waters will stop its movement if the lure collides with an enemy champion with a spell shield (does not attach) or upon colliding with Wind Wall (does not get destroyed). This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. The targeted area does not change unless the ability was cast beyond maximum range. If the lure attaches to an enemy champion, a countdown will appear at their position to signify when the shark is about to emerge. The countdown begins from 4, and ticks down by one every 0.5 second. Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins. For all associated collection items, see Fizz (Collection) . Original View in 3D 880 15.11.2011 Fizz is an amphibious yordle, who dwells among the reefs surrounding Bilgewater. He often retrieves and returns the tithes cast into the sea by superstitious captains, but even the saltiest of sailors know better than to cross him—for many are the tales of those who have underestimated this slippery character. Often mistaken for some manner of capricious ocean spirit, he seems able to command the beasts of the deep, and delights in confounding his allies and enemies alike.

But even in the Void, Fizz is widely considered to be extremely irritating for his love of bringing life into existence just to annoy the Watchers.
