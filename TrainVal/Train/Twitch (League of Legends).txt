Deadly Venom: For each stack, the target is dealt 「 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 (based on level) (+ 3% AP) true damage per second over the duration, 」 「 6 / 12 / 18 / 24 / 30 (based on level) (+ 18% AP) total true damage over the duration, 」 for a maximum of 「 6 / 12 / 18 / 24 / 30 (based on level) (+ 18% AP) true damage with each tick. 」 「 36 / 72 / 108 / 144 / 180 (based on level) (+ 108% AP) total true damage over the duration. 」 This effect is considered a poison . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Default damage True Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked See Notes The first 5 stacks on a target are indicated each by a small mark around them, while a target affected by the maximum stacks of 6 is indicated by a single large mark above them instead. Deadly Venom does not affect structures . Being applied on-hit, Deadly Venom stacks will still be applied if the attack was parried or blocked , but not if dodged and/or missed if Twitch is blinded . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit AP ratio per tick changed to 4% AP . Edit Ambush Ambush COST: 40 Mana COOLDOWN : 16 CAST TIME: none Detection Radius: 500 Active: After a 1-second delay, Twitch becomes camouflaged for a duration. Attacking or casting Venom Cask or Contaminate ends Ambush immediately. Stealth Duration: 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 / 14 During this time, Twitch gains 10% bonus movement speed , increased to 30% while facing enemy champions within a 1000-unit radius who cannot see him. Upon breaking stealth, Twitch gains bonus attack speed for 5 seconds. Bonus Attack Speed: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% When an enemy champion dies while afflicted with Deadly Venom , Ambush's cooldown is reset. Link ▶️ (Entering stealth) "Sneaky, sneaky... " Link ▶️ (Exiting stealth) "I was hiding! Hehehahaa, grr!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Entering stealth cancels Twitch's current basic attack. Ambush follows the same rules as stealth but he can still perform actions normally before entering camouflage . Activating Recall during the 1-second delay allows him to channel it while stealthed. If Twitch enters stasis during the delay, he will gain the camouflage after the stasis ends. Edit Venom Cask Venom Cask COST: 70 Mana COOLDOWN: 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 950 SPEED: 1400 Active: Twitch hurls a cask of venom that explodes at the target location, applying Deadly Venom to enemies hit and granting sight of the area. The area then becomes contaminated for 3 seconds, applying a Deadly Venom stack each second to enemies within and slowing them. Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% (+ 6% per 100 AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Non-Damaging Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Venom Cask can apply a maximum of 4 Deadly Venom stacks per enemy. Venom Cask's missile will fail to fire if Twitch is suppressed during the cast time. (bug) Edit Contaminate Contaminate COST: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 1200 Active: Twitch sends out a lethal toxin to each nearby enemy afflicted by Deadly Venom , dealing them physical damage . Base Physical Damage: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 Contaminate deals additional physical damage and 30% AP magic damage for each stack of Deadly Venom on the target. Physical Damage Per Stack: 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 (+ 35% bonus AD) Minimum Mixed Damage: 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 (+ 35% bonus AD) (+ 30% AP) Maximum Mixed Damage: 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 / 270 (+ 210% bonus AD) (+ 180% AP) A nearby enemy with Deadly Venom is required to cast this ability. The target does not have to be visible to be targeted by this ability. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Twitch is given a range indicator for Contaminate's radius upon infecting an enemy champion with Deadly Venom (actual range is slightly larger than shown by the indicator). Contaminate will not damage enemy targets whose Deadly Venom stacks wear off or if they move out of Contaminate's range before the cast time completes. If the target moves out of range after the cast time, the missile will still hit and deal damage. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Bonus AD ratio per stack changed to 30% bonus AD . AP ratio per stack changed to 35% AP . Edit Spray and Pray Spray and Pray COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 90 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: Twitch's attack range RANGE: 1100 WIDTH: 120 SPEED: 5000 Active: Twitch gains bonus attack damage and 300 bonus attack range for 6 seconds, during which his basic attacks are replaced by bolts that travel slightly further than his attack range in a straight line, dealing damage to every enemy unit hit. Bonus Attack Damage: 40 / 55 / 70 The bolts deal 100% − 60% (based on enemies hit) of the attack's damage , apply on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness, and can critically strike . Link ▶️ "Pins and needles!" Hide Details Tips & Tricks Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Basic damage Physical Drawn Counters Parries Projectile Blocked Blocked The extra distance that the bolts travel scales with bonus attack range. Spray and Pray allows Twitch to outrange turrets by 50 units, allowing him to hit them without them returning fire. Twitch targets his line attack at his target's location at the start of his attack windup. The bolts reach targets at a delay, composed of Twitch's windup time and distance the bolt has to travel at finite speed. Even the primary target can dodge the attack if they are moving quickly enough. The bolt projectiles will naturally pass through terrain and enemy structures (the latter will be damaged by bolts even if they are not directly targeted). If Twitch is blinded before winding up the attack, the hits will miss against all targets. Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury interacts with Spray and Pray's bonus attack range but not with the modified missile effect (the secondary bolts will not have pass-through effects). Whenever the bolts penetrate a target, a small elongated cloud appears at the location, which's VFX and SFX can be seen and heard inside the Fog of War. The bolts' travel distance scales with the full value of Twitch's attack range increases such as Rapid Firecannon , but not with size increases (which only increase his effective attack range, thereby the target range). (Outdated as of V10.13 , now can hit everything with edge range, except for turrets) The center of a unit must be within the maximum travel distance of the bolt missile, and in front of the spawn location ( Twitch's center) for the bolt to be able to hit them. Other than this condition, the bolt missile has to only touch (pass within its half width of 60 units) the edge of the unit's radius. This is standard behaviour for linear skillshots . Tips & Tricks Runaan's Hurricane's bolts can target the same units that are hit by Twitch's penetrated bolt , increasing the total damage dealt to them and applying on-hit effects twice.

Original View in 3D 790 30.04.2009 A Zaunite plague rat by birth, but a connoisseur of filth by passion, Twitch is not afraid to get his paws dirty. Aiming a chem-powered crossbow at the gilded heart of Piltover, he has vowed to show those in the city above just how filthy they really are. Always a sneaky sneak, when he’s not rooting around in the Sump, he’s digging deep into other people’s garbage for discarded treasures… and perhaps a moldy sandwich. Doug Boyd Joshua 'HUGEnFAST' Brian Smith Loot eligible Kingpin View in 3D 520 20.11.2009 Many in Bilgewater get called a filthy rat, but none deserve the title more than the Kingpin himself. While other crime bosses in the port city may loathe to get their hands dirty, Twitch revels in wading into the filth himself—crossbow in hand, and a finely aged egg in his pocket. Doug Boyd Xi Zhang Bilgewater: Burning Tides Loot eligible Legacy Whistler Village View in 3D 520 12.02.2010 Whistler Village is an idyllic mountain hamlet known for spiced cocoa, competitive winter sports, and rumors of an insane man-rat living in the woods. Attempts to appease the creature with spiced cocoa and competitive winter sports have been unsuccessful. Doug Boyd Max Grecke Winter Sports Loot eligible Legacy Medieval View in 3D Special 15.12.2009 An assassin-for-hire living beneath Dread Fortress Zaun, Twitch is a disgusting malefactor who has tipped every one of his killing implements in moist, toxic garbage. He excitedly awaits each contract, eager to kill, steal, and destroy as much as he can. Doug Boyd Bo 'chenbowow' Chen Medieval Loot inelgible Chromas Medieval Twitch Chromas Amethyst Obsidian Sapphire Crime City View in 3D 975 13.10.2010 Deeply violent and severely paranoid, Twitch runs one of the largest crime syndicates in the nation. His orders are carried out by a literal army of rat-men, the only creatures he even comes close to trusting. Doug Boyd Izzy Medrano Crime City Loot eligible Vandal View in 3D 975 22.02.2011 An irradiated humanoid rat with an appetite for wanton collateral damage, Twitch is the number one provider of putrefied nuclear slime grenades to unsuspecting settlements everywhere. Equal parts audacious and paranoid, it is nearly impossible to stop his reckless rampages.

It's been a long time since he was a competent medical professional, as he no longer abides by the adage “do no harm.” Doug Boyd Rudy Siswanto Omega Squad Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Omega Squad Twitch Chromas Obsidian Pearl Sandstone Ice King View in 3D 1350 06.12.2018 Twitch is a bitter, hateful creature who has jealously watched the Winterlands from his frozen burrow since time immemorial. Finally driven to the surface by twisted delusions of grandeur, he now seeks to usurp the Poro King, corrupting his subjects with an ancient, icy curse.

Unsurprisingly, the cuddly rat-man rogue spends nearly every turn stealing his companions' equipment, mumbling of a vast conspiracy to overthrow him from his 'toilet kingdom'.

Doug Boyd West Studio Dragon World Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Dragonslayer Twitch Chromas Citrine Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Tanzanite High Noon View in 3D 1350 26.05.2022 It starts like this: An ill wind blows across the desert, dessicated rats turn up in the streets, rotting under the hot sun. Then the traveling undertaker arrives. No one knows who (or what) he is, nor where he hails from… But it seems even Death has a bone to pick with the King of the Sulfur Rail. Another Harbinger arrives.
