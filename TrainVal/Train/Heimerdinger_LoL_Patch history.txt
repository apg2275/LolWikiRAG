Gameplay Collection Audio Patch history Past versions Current version [ ] V14.2 H-28G Evolution Turret New Effect: Now updates its stats every 1 second in order to reflect level ups, rank ups, and the caster's changes in ability power. Bug Fix: Warden's Mail and Randuin's Omen no longer improperly slow their attack speed. H-28Q Apex Turret New Effect: Now updates its stats every 1 second in order to reflect level ups, rank ups, and the caster's changes in ability power. V13.22 Stats Base attack speed increased to 0. 658 from 0. 625 . Attack windup reduced to 20% from 20. 078125 %. V13.15 UPGRADE!!! H-28Q Apex Turret Base health changed to 725 − 1525 (based on level) from 850 − 1450 (based on level) . Health AP ratio changed to 50% AP at all levels from 25% − 200% (based on level) AP . Armor increased to 30 − 90 (based on level) from 10 − 80 (based on level) . Magic resistance increased to 30 − 90 (based on level) from 25 − 65 (based on level) . V13.7 H-28G Evolution Turret Bug introduced affecting Q Recharge on Spawn, and Q Charge Display Previously, Heimerdinger began the game with all 3 turret charges. Now, Heimerdinger begins the game with 1 turret charge, but 3 charges displayed on the 'buff' icon, with the number of charges on his Q button de-synced from the number shown floating around him and on the buff/debuff GUI. When Heimerdinger accrues 3 turrets (as tracked on his Q button counter AND the buff bar counter), they will match until his next death. After death / respawn, the counter on the buff bar will reset to 3 (as in prior patches, Heimerdinger would always respawn with a full 3 turrets). After death / respawn, Heimerdinger will actually have however many turrets would have accrued naturally since his last life, with no reset on death. This means that he may use all 3 of his turrets in lane, die, and not have any more to put down after teleporting in to lane for quite a while, which is different behavior than in prior patches. When Heimerdinger uses his R (even when canceled) his turret counter on the ability is set to 3. The number of floating 'Nuts' or bolts (Or Dragon Eggs, depending on skin) is synced up with the count on the buff bar, not on his Q. This is misleading if you are used to quickly glancing at your character (or an enemy Heimerdinger) to track his turret count, as many times throughout the game he may visually appear to have 3 turrets ready but not actually have all 3 available. UPGRADE!!! Undocumented change - No longer automatically refreshes the cooldowns of Hextech Micro-Rockets or Electron Stun Grenade when cast. If you previously used these abilities, and then cast UPGRADE!!! , you will now be unable to cast the upgraded form of Hextech Micro-Rockets or Electron Stun Grenade until their cooldown timer has elapsed. Previously, you could exploit UPGRADE!!! by flexing it on and off each 3 seconds to renew the cooldowns on these two abilities indefinitely. V13.1b H-28G Evolution Turret Turret base health reduced to 130 − 640 (based on level) from 175 − 700 (based on level) .
