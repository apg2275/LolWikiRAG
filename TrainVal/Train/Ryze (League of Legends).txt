Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Counters Grounded Disruption Disabled Interrupted Realm Warp will try to predict whether an ally is trying to run out of it or not and will not teleport allies that are very near the edge and move click outside of it. Blinked units retain the same relative positions to one another upon arrival. If no champions but one or more minions are teleported, Realm Warp will not teleport the minion closest to its center, and furthermore shuffles the positions of the other teleported minions . (bug) If a champion is present, the innermost minion is teleported on top the outermost champion's new position, and the remaining minions are teleported to their proper intended positions. (bug) Realm Warp will teleport allies even if they are in a zombie state , are untargetable , or are affected by crowd control . Realm Warp will not teleport allies that are using an ability that preloads UnstoppableForceMarker or are being affected by another ally's Realm Warp first. Realm Warp will still teleport an allied Rift Herald that is winding up its leap. Realm Warp has various interactions with channeled abilities that are being performed by an ally. Some channels will prevent their caster from being teleported and others will not. For channels that do not prevent the teleport, Realm Warp will specifically not apply its silence to the caster. Cast times will not prevent the teleport. The following channels will prevent the teleport: Caitlyn's Ace in the Hole Galio's Hero's Entrance Kayn's Umbral Trespass Jhin's Curtain Call Warwick's Jaws of the Beast Xerath's Rite of the Arcane Recall / Empowered Recall Teleport / Unleashed Teleport The following table refers for interactions while Ryze is channeling : Type Channel Attacking Allowed Abilities Allowed Movement Allowed Items Usable All the other item-actives are usable Disabled N/A Interrupted by Zhonya's Hourglass Consumables Usable Spells Usable Barrier Clarity Cleanse Exhaust Ghost Heal Ignite Smite Flash Teleport Recall Hexflash Mark Dash Disabled N/A Interrupted by N/A Interrupted by Death, unless protected by Resurrection Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins.

Original View in 3D 260 21.02.2009 Widely considered one of the most adept sorcerers on Runeterra, Ryze is an ancient, hard-bitten archmage with an impossibly heavy burden to bear. Armed with immense arcane power and a boundless constitution, he tirelessly hunts for World Runes—fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these artifacts before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra. Dave B.

Dave B. Mitchell Francis Tneh, West Studio Arcana Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Arcana Ryze Chromas Amethyst Catseye Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] His name comes from Riot Games's CEO Brandon 'Ryze' Beck's alias. Ryze was one of the original playable characters in the the Summoner's Rift Battle Training tutorial, along with Ashe and Garen . Ryze was the first champion to have 9 skins. He was also the first to have 2 Harrowing ones ( Zombie in 2010, Pirate in 2012). The other champion is Katarina ( Kitty Cat and Death Sworn ). Hecarim has 2 Harrowing skins but his Reaper skin did not come in Harrowing event. His giant scroll can be seen behind an overturned chair in the trailer for the game's Mac version. While the scroll is supposedly indestructible Nocturne rips it apart it in 'A Twist of Fate'. Yet later on the scroll is whole again but whether it is capable of self-repairing is uncertain. Ryze was deemed as having next to no counterplay in Ultra Rapid Fire (2014 edition) and was disabled in non-custom games.
