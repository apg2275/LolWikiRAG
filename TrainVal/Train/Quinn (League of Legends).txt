The azurite eagle Valor is used to visualise various abilities , and appears in emotes . He is not one distinct unit, instead being used as both a projectile , and as a visual indicator of effects. Abilities [ ] Edit Harrier Harrier EFFECT RADIUS: 525 Innate: Quinn's Blinding Assault against the primary target, Vault , and Skystrike mark enemies hit with Vulnerable for 4 seconds, during which they are revealed . If no Vulnerable target exists for 1 second, Valor automatically marks a nearby visible enemy. He cannot do this again for 8 − 2. 93 (based on critical strike chance) seconds after the mark expired or was consumed or overwritten by another mark. Quinn's basic attacks against Vulnerable targets are empowered to consume the mark to deal 10 − 95 (based on level) (+ 16% − 50% (based on level) AD) bonus physical damage . While Behind Enemy Lines is active, Harrier is disabled and all Vulnerable marks are removed.

Harrier is consumed even if it is parried, the attack is negated in any case. Harrier will not mark enemy minions while Quinn is not visible , but will mark enemy champions . Map-Specific Differences One for All differences edit Quinns may only trigger the bonus damage from their own Vulnerable debuffs.

Map-Specific Differences One for All differences edit Quinns will gain the passive bonus for attacking a Vulnerable enemy versus enemies marked by any Quinn . Note that only the Quinn who applied the mark can consume the mark for bonus damage. One Quinn can apply the mark and then deliberately not trigger the mark to allow their allies to continually trigger the passive bonus. Arena differences edit Attack speed changed to 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70%. Cooldown changed to 20 / 17. 5 / 15 / 12. 5 / 10 seconds.

She then leaps back 525 units away from them. Physical damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 20% bonus AD) Heightened Senses can be cast during either of the dashes. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Quinn will track the target if they change locations. She will dash to the target's previous location without applying Vault's effects if the target is too far away or moves beyond 1200 units. Vault resets Quinn's remaining attack cooldown a short delay after the first dash ends (even if interrupted). This delay is a fuzzy 0. 25 to 0. 5 seconds and this matches up with the moment the target of Vault is marked as Vulnerable . Quinn will automatically attempt to attack the target once she completes Vault . The target will turn to face the opposite direction after being knocked back . Unlike its constant cast range Vault's bounce's can vary to allow Quinn to close or to make a gap between herself and the target (depending on casting position) or even to jump through a wall (if there is enough landing room on the other side). Vault also interrupts basic attacks with uncancellable windups . (bug) Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Quinn_EVideo.ogv Edit Behind Enemy Lines Behind Enemy Lines COST: 100 / 50 / 0 Mana COOLDOWN : 3 CAST TIME: 0. 25 Active: Quinn channels for 2 seconds, signaling Valor to pair up. Upon completion, he picks her up and they unite, increasing her total movement speed , granting her ghosting , and allowing her to cast Skystrike . Behind Enemy Lines can be recast after 0. 5 seconds during the channel. Total Movement Speed Increase: 70 / 100 / 130% Taking damage from non- minions while Behind Enemy Lines is active or while Quinn is channeling the ability causes her to lose the bonus total movement speed for 3 seconds. Becoming immobilized , grounded , or silenced ends Behind Enemy Lines immediately and puts it on cooldown without performing Skystrike . Once Behind Enemy Lines has been learned, respawning or returning to the allied summoning platform will spawn Valor instantly. Recast: Quinn cancels the channel, placing Behind Enemy Lines on cooldown. Link ▶️ "Valor, to me!" Edit Skystrike Skystrike CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 700 Active: Quinn detaches from Valor , ending Behind Enemy Lines' effects and raining arrows down around her, dealing 70% AD physical damage to nearby enemies and marking them as Vulnerable . Declaring a basic attack or casting Blinding Assault or Vault during Behind Enemy Lines automatically activates Skystrike . Hide Behind Enemy Lines Details Skystrike Details Video Targeting input Auto Counters Grounded Disruption Disabled Interrupted Notes Taking damage from non- minions removes the bonus movement speed buff temporarily by suppressing it with the status effect of a slow . Behind Enemy Lines does not refund its mana cost if the channel was canceled via recast. The only exception is if Quinn's mana falls below the mana cost , in which case she is granted enough mana back (the equal amount needed) to be able to cast Behind Enemy Lines again. Respawning or returning to the summoning platform will not spawn Valor if Behind Enemy Lines is on cooldown. If Valor is spawned by respawning or returning to the summoning platform , Skystrike will be disabled from being manually cast for 2. 5 seconds upon uniting. However, it will still automatically activate upon declaring a basic attack or casting Blinding Assault or Vault . Behind Enemy Lines ends immediately without Skystrike being cast if she enters or is inside the enemy fountain . The ability will go on full cooldown . Quinn will also spawn Valor when entering the enemy fountain but she will instantly lose him afterwards. Self- immobilizations such as Zhonya's Hourglass also count for ending Behind Enemy Lines . The following table refers for interactions while Quinn is channeling : Behind Enemy Lines is not a movement channel , and so will not be interrupted by root and ground .
