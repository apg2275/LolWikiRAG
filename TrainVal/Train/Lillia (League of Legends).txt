This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Spell shield will not prevent Lillia from gaining a Prance stack. For the purpose of aim-assist, Lillia's attack range is reduced 「 to 275 」 「 by 50 」 during Blooming Blows's cast time. Edit Watch Out! Eep! Watch Out! Eep!

Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Lillia dashes to her target location over 0. 627 to 0. 759 seconds , but cannot move before the strike goes off at 0. 759 seconds, regardless. Lillia can hop over the edges of certain walls despite the ability being unable to traverse terrain. Edit Swirlseed Swirlseed COST: 70 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 CAST TIME: 0. 4 TARGET RANGE: 700 / Global EFFECT RADIUS: 150 WIDTH: 120 SPEED: 5000 / 1400 Active: Lillia lobs a seed at the target location that rolls forward indefinitely. The seed detonates upon hitting an enemy or terrain while on the ground, dealing magic damage to enemies in a cone, slowing them by 40% for 3 seconds and revealing them for 2 seconds. Magic Damage: 70 / 95 / 120 / 145 / 170 (+ 60% AP) Swirlseed will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes See Notes Swirlseed's origin is determined from Lillia's position at the start of cast, the rolling direction is determined from Lillia's position at the end of cast (when the projectile is created, not when the seed starts rolling). Spell shield does not prevent the seed from detonating thus striking nearby targets. Projectile destroying effects will still make the rolling seed detonate upon colliding with them, but not when the initial arcing missile is destroyed. If Braum's Unbreakable blocks the initial projectile, it is destroyed and deals 0 damage to him, as well as not triggering the cone-shaped area of effect. The spot at which the seed will collide with terrain is highlighted while it is rolling. Collision indicator Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit Cooldown changed to 18 seconds. Edit Lilting Lullaby Lilting Lullaby COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 150 / 130 / 110 CAST TIME: 0. 4 EFFECT RADIUS: Global Active: Lillia casts a magical lullaby over all enemy champions affected by Dream Dust , which arrives after 0. 3 seconds and renders them drowsy for 1. 5 seconds, slowing them by 10%. After the duration, they fall asleep for a duration. Sleep Duration: 2 / 2. 25 / 2. 5 The next instance of non- persistent non- minion non-small and medium monster damage against a sleeping target consumes the debuff to deal additional magic damage . Magic Damage: 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 40% AP) An enemy champion affected by Dream Dust is required to cast this ability. Link ▶️ "Sleepy time!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked The sleep debuff is named Shhh.. They're Asleep . Lillia can move during Lilting Lullaby's cast time. The additional magic damage dealt is accredited to Lillia and benefits from her magic penetration . Lilting Lullaby's missile will still hit even if the target becomes untargetable during the cast time. (bug) If the target becomes so while it is travelling, it will be destroyed. Lilting Lullaby's application does not trigger aggro from turrets , only its triggering damage does. Dream Dust's persistent damage will still cause Lillia to trigger turret aggro, unless she casts Lilting Lullaby right before it runs out. Dream Dust will mark targets if Lilting Lullaby is learned.

Original View in 3D 975 22.07.2020 Intensely shy, the fae fawn Lillia skittishly wanders Ionia's forests. Hiding just out of sight of mortals—whose mysterious natures have long captivated, but intimidated, her—Lillia hopes to discover why their dreams no longer reach the ancient Dreaming Tree. She now travels Ionia with a magical branch in hand, in an effort to find people's unrealized dreams. Only then can Lillia herself bloom and help others untangle their fears to find the sparkle within. Eep!
