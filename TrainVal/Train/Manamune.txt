Similar items Archangel's Staff Winter's Approach Essence Reaver Notes Empowered basic attacks gained from abilities will count for triggering Manaflow upon consuming the attack. Awe grants a total of 12. 5 bonus attack damage by itself without any stacks of Manaflow . With Manamune's attack damage stat this totals to 47. 5 . The user preserves their current mana whenever they increase their maximum mana from consuming charges of Manaflow . Manaless champions cannot trigger Manaflow . Summoning pets also triggers Manaflow . Selling a Manaflow item removes the bonus mana gained from the effect but retains the stacks if these items are bought again, regardless of which item generated the stacks.
