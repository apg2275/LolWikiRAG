Once the first stack has been applied, any allied champion's basic attack applies an additional stack to the target on-hit . The fourth stack against a target consumes them all to deal 26 − 196 (based on level) magic damage and stun them for 1. 25 − 1. 75 (based on level) seconds. This effect cannot apply to the same target more than once every few seconds. During this immunity period, affected targets take 「 bonus magic damage equal to 20% of the trigger damage 」 「 5. 2 − 39. 2 (based on level) bonus magic damage 」 from Braum's basic attacks.

If there are no nearby enemy champions, Braum will dash to land up-to 150 units on the far side of his target. The maximum dash range without enemy champions present is ~650. An enemy champion on the far side of the ally will allow Braum to dash a total of up-to 800 units. If Unbreakable is cast during the dash, Winter's Bite and Glacial Fissure may also be cast. If the dash is interrupted, neither Braum nor his ally receive the bonus resistances. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base resistances changed to 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60.

The first instance of damage dealt by a champion from this direction is reduced by 100%. Unbreakable does not affect turrets . Damage reduction: 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55% Barrier Duration: 3 / 3. 25 / 3. 5 / 3. 75 / 4 While his shield is raised, Braum also gains 10% bonus movement speed and ghosting . Link ▶️ "My shield is here for you." Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Definitions Incoming: Damage sources coming from somewhere facing the shield. Those coming from different sides are not affected. Projectiles: Sped up entities not classified as a unit ( champions , minions , monsters , etc.) Intercepting: A projectile hitting Braum because he is standing in front of the intended target. In addition to being redirected, an intercepted projectile is also destroyed after hitting Braum (although this is only applicable to pass-through projectiles). Unbreakable's full damage reduction can block multiple instances of damage if they're dealt at the same time. Moving units do not count for being blocked by Unbreakable . Champion summoned units are not classified as units until they hit the ground (e.g. Sapling Toss ) and thus will interact with Unbreakable whilst en route. Projectiles whose effects trigger on collision will still trigger - dealing damage, applying debuffs , creating area of effects and marking the target as 'hit'. Projectiles that create an area of effect upon their collision will still affect other units and not only Braum . Projectiles that cannot hit Braum or his allies (such as an enemy Prismatic Barrier ) will not be intercepted. [2] Soraka's Starcall's Rejuvenation projectile is however blocked. The damage reduction will affect any source of damage whose origin is in front of the shield. This includes: All intercepted projectiles. Melee and non-projectile-based ranged attacks. Instantaneous direction-targeted abilities (e.g. Arcanopulse , Final Spark , Lifeform Disintegration Ray .) Instantaneously-placed ground-targeted abilities (e.g. Lay Waste , Pillar of Flame , Rupture ) relative to the ability's center and not the caster's. Point-blank area-of-effects (e.g. Ground Slam , Tantrum , Time Bomb not targeted at Braum ) Instantaneous targeted abilities (e.g. Malefic Visions , Transfusion , Time Bomb targeted at Braum ) and AoE DoT (e.g. Spirit Fire , Tormented Shadow , Poison Trail ). The damage reduction only benefits Braum . Damage over time is calculated per tick but the full damage reduction will still only apply to a single tick. If the damage mitigated by Unbreakable exceeds a minimum threshold it is represented with floating text similar to the damage mitigated by shields (' -X ') This floating text is always shown for the single fully-reduced damage source. Braum's facing direction is in the direction he's moving in. If Braum is protected by a spell shield , both it and the one-time-use full damage reduction can be consumed by a single blockable spell. The one-time-use full damage reduction will not be consumed if the damage source is nothing but true damage . Unbreakable will grant assist credit if the enemy whose damaging projectile is blocked from is killed within 10 seconds.

Magic Damage: 150 / 300 / 450 (+ 60% AP) The first target hit is knocked up for at least 0. 6 seconds, increased if they are further away from Braum . All other enemies hit are knocked up for 0. 6 seconds. Maximum Knockup Duration: 1 / 1. 5 / 2 A field of ice is created along the fissure's path, lasting for 4 seconds and slowing enemies within the area every 0. 25 seconds. The field disappears after the duration ends in the same order and speed it was created with.

Every mead hall north of Frostheld toasts his legendary strength, said to have felled a forest of oaks in a single night, and punched an entire mountain into rubble. Bearing an enchanted vault door as his shield, Braum roams the frozen north sporting a mustachioed smile as big as his muscles—a true friend to all those in need.

When the dragons returned, most of the ancient warriors had passed away, leaving Braum to take up their task with only his mighty shield to defend the innocent.

He's definitely not a stickler for 7th-edition Riftquest rules, and there are certainly not snax stains on his character sheet. That would be unbecoming of such a gallant warrior. JB Blanc Unknown artist Rift Quest Loot eligible Santa View in 3D 1350 14.12.2016 He's making that list, and checking it twice—but there's a lot of room for improvement because Braum is so nice!

He is also the second to feature two joke animations, the first being Heimerdinger . Braum's dance resembles the Ukrainian Cossack dance. Braum (as pronounced by his voice-actor: /bɹɔ:m/) is the American variant of German surname Brahm [3] /bɹɑ:mz/) , originating either from: Proto-Germanic *bremaz "prickly bush, blackberry " > Middle High German brame , Low Saxon Braam , English: broom (also *bremilaz > English bramble ), or reduction of Hebrew Abram אַבְרָם, from Semitic * ʔab "father" [4] & *r-w-m ~ *r-y-m "high". [5] Braum strongly resembles the figure in the old Juggernaut mastery. When Braum feeds a Poro a Poro-Snax they will grow a mustache, with the color being determined by which skin he is using.
