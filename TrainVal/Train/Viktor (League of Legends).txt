Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit New Effect: Gains 25 Hex Fragments per round. Edit Siphon Power Siphon Power COST: 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 mana COOLDOWN : 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 600 SPEED: 2000 Active: Viktor throws a device at the target enemy that deals magic damage . He also grants himself a shield for 27 − 105 (based on level) (+ 18% AP) for 2. 5 seconds and gains Discharge for 3. 5 seconds. Magic Damage: 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 (+ 40% AP) Discharge: Viktor's next basic attack is empowered to become non-projectile and deal modified magic damage . Modified Magic Damage: 20 / 45 / 70 / 95 / 120 (+ 100% AD) (+ 60% AP) Total Magic Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 100% AD) (+ 100% AP) Augment: Turbocharge : After the device hits, Viktor gains 30% bonus movement speed for 2. 5 seconds and the shield's strength is increased by 60%, up to 48 − 184 (based on level) (+ 32% AP) . Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Blocked Missing See Notes All damage dealt by Spellblade on the enhanced attack is converted into magic damage . Spell shield does not prevent Viktor from gaining Discharge . Critical strike and life steal only interact with the basic attack damage component. Only the initial projectile can be intercepted . Discharge's empowered attack can be blocked (damage is negated and the empowered attack will still be consumed). The empowered attack will trigger but not be consumed nor apply its effects against structures nor wards . PENDING FOR TEST: : Discharge's interaction with parrying effects ( dodge and blind ). If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Edit Gravity Field Gravity Field COST: 65 mana COOLDOWN: 17 / 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 800 Active: Viktor deploys a gravity field at the target location for 4 seconds. After a 0. 75 -second delay, it activates to slow enemies within, persisting for 0. 25 seconds after leaving the area or generating 3 stacks. Slow: 30 / 34 / 38 / 42 / 45% The field applies a stack to enemies within every 0. 5 seconds, stacking up to 3 times. The third stack consumes them all to knock down and stun the target for 1. 5 seconds. The target then becomes immune to Gravity Field's effects, occurring once per cast. Augment: Magnetize : Viktor's other abilities, excluding Chaos Storm's persistent damage, slow enemies hit by 20% for 1 second. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Counters Spell shield Blocked Gravity Field will remain active if Viktor dies. Gravity Field's animation can be seen by both teams through fog of war . If an enemy enters the area of effect while untargetable , they may generate stacks even after becoming stunned once, causing them to get stunned up-to 3 times by a single Gravity Field . (bug) Edit Death Ray Death Ray COST: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 550 RANGE: 500 EFFECT RADIUS: 500 WIDTH: 90 SPEED: 1050 / 1500 Active: Viktor fires an energy beam along the target path that deals magic damage to enemies hit and briefly grants sight of the area. Magic Damage: 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+ 50% AP) Augment: Aftershock : The path explodes along the beam's wake after 1 second, dealing magic damage to enemies hit. Magic Damage: 20 / 50 / 80 / 110 / 140 (+ 80% AP) Total Magic Damage: 90 / 160 / 230 / 300 / 370 (+ 130% AP) Hide Details Info Targeting input Vector Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Viktor may freely act while the ray is traveling. The effected area is set upon casting, no matter how far away Viktor moves. Unlike a leash, Death Ray will not break off its own effect. The laser grants a moderate area of sight around where the beam strikes the ground. If Death Ray is intercepted , the initial ray is not destroyed. However, the capability to be blocked only applies to the laser as it hits the ground. Viktor can cast the ability over the wall and it will not be destroyed or intercepted. Augmented Death Ray will still cause the entire target area to explode even if the laser is blocked. If Viktor dies while he is firing the beam it only deals damage up to the location at the time of his death. Edit Chaos Storm Chaos Storm COST: 100 mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 700 EFFECT RADIUS: 350 / 700 SPEED: 200 / 300 / 250 / 375 Active: Viktor conjures an arcane singularity at the target location, dealing magic damage to enemies within the area and disrupting their channeled abilities . Magic Damage: 100 / 175 / 250 (+ 50% AP) The singularity then remains active for 6. 5 seconds, dealing magic damage to enemies within it every second and granting sight of the area. The singularity targets the nearest champion hit by its initial damage and will follow them, moving faster based on its proximity to Viktor . Magic Damage Per Tick: 65 / 105 / 145 (+ 45% AP) Total Magic Damage: 490 / 805 / 1120 (+ 320% AP) Chaos Storm can be recast at any time while the singularity is active. Recast: Viktor directs the singularity to the target location or enemy champion. Augment: Perfect Storm : The singularity moves 25% faster. Chaos Storm's recast can be used while affected by cast-inhibiting crowd control . Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked The disrupt is 'wrapped' into a status effect that says the target is Silenced for 0. 25 seconds, but it does not actually silence . It however makes sure that the disrupt is prevented by immunity to silences . Viktor can command the singularity regardless of how far away he is from it. The singularity will remain active even if Viktor dies. Any commands it was issued prior to his death will not be interrupted. Chaos Storm reaches its maximum speed at 300 units and minimum speed at 900 units away from Viktor . Including the initial damage, Chaos Storm deals 7 instances of damage. The storm will follow its target even if they are not visible , effectively giving away their position. Chaos Storm can be recast to follow Viktor . However, upon reaching him, the singularity will stop following Viktor . Chaos Storm is not obstructed by terrain. Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins.

An idealist who seeks to lift the people of Zaun to a new level of understanding, he believes that only by embracing a glorious evolution of technology can humanity’s full potential be realized. With a body augmented by steel and science, Viktor is zealous in his pursuit of this bright future. Owen Thomas Michal Ivan, Sixmorevodka Studio Loot eligible Full Machine View in 3D 975 29.12.2011 Created from the same circuitry as the Full Metal champion, Jayce, Viktor was cast into the tunnels beneath the robot fighting arenas to serve as a janitoribot—while his twin was groomed for glory, simulcast en español. Upgrading himself with the cast-offs of the destroyed, he has sworn la venganza.

But his work is far from complete, and even now he tinkers on newer, deadlier creations to crush all who oppose him. Owen Thomas Michal Ivan, Puppetworks Animation Studio Battlecast Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Death Sworn View in 3D 1350 25.10.2017 On a cold, dreary night, a pioneering inventor was tried and hanged for preaching his glorious vision of the future—a world in which the living knelt before the dead. Death had to admire Viktor's conviction, and sent him back into the mortal world, blessed with powers beyond imagination. Owen Thomas Alvin Lee Death Sworn Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall PsyOps View in 3D 1350 17.09.2020 Leader of the rogue military known as the Black Rose Group, Viktor is a psychic technomancer whose vision for a utopian world was abandoned when he suddenly departed High Command decades prior. Obsessed with an alien 'gate' uncovered during the Arctic Ops event, his experiments into human bioweapons would allow him to breach it and upend the global order.

Dr. Viktor may be the Mechanical Devil's kept engineer now, but his work began as charity: trying to “rehome” the souls of the dead in clockwork bodies, in order to circumvent mortality itself. Shame that Mordekaiser saw the good doctor's kindness and struck him a deal he could not deny.
