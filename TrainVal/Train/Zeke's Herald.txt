Trivia Zeke's Herald is named after a character from the webcomic as a reward for the creator Tim Buckley gaining over 1000 referrals. Zeke's Herald is the second iteration of a supportive aura item. It was remade from Stark's Fervor and then replaced by Zeke's Harbinger which was then developed into its modern form as Zeke's Convergence . If more than 1 champion carries this item, the buff of the aura will grant to even another carrier but cannot stack, thus if 3 champions carry this item you only gain the benefits twice once from yourself, once from the allied aura.
