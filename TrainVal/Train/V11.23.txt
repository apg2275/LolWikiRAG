Objective Bounties New Effect: The team that is sufficiently behind can now receive objective bounties, calculated based on their experience and gold deficit as well as how many more Dragons and turrets the opposing team has secured. The bounties activate 15 seconds after the team falls below the threshold and deactivate the same time after they rise above it, which extends if the team is in-combat with an objective that has an active bounty. They are highlighted on the minimap and the tab menu for both teams. When an objective bounty is claimed, the bounty's gold is distributed evenly among all team members. The bounty's value can increase by up to 60% as a team falls further behind. Objective bounties can activate on the following objectives: Baron Nashor : 500 , up to 800 Dragons and Elder Dragon : 500 , up to 800 Rift Herald : 500 , up to 800 Inner turrets : 400 , up to 640 Nexus turrets : 400 , up to 640 Outer turrets : 250 , up to 400 Champions [ ] Caitlyn - Art & Sustainability Update General Complete visual update across all skins.

Now works like Gangplank's Parrrley or Ezreal's Mystic Shot ; When the attack applies on-hit effects and Graves has 100 stacks, it'll apply the effect.
