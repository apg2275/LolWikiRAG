Single-target DoT spells (for example, Mordekaiser's Children of the Grave or Morgana's Dark Binding ) that previously caused the minor slow effect on Rylai's Crystal Scepter , will grant 100% Spell Vamp (and continue to slow for the minor amount). Reduced healing effects will not affect the new Spell Vamp (to make the behavior consistent with life steal and spell vamp). However, look for us to update this in the future. This also means that Spirit Visage will not increase your spell vamp health restore. Critical chance and critical chance per level removed as a base stat.
