Old icons 1st version 2nd version Trivia This item was inspired by the Iron Solari Conclave, a fan-made forum group that was named after Leona and is supported by Michael 'IronStylus' Maurino . Numerous other groups, led by various Riot staff members, were also formed and "warred" with the Iron Solari, but the Iron Solari were arguably the most successful. A reworked version of this item once existed on the PBE for testing to be potentially shipped to V8.6 . The active was changed to deploy a small field on the target area that granted damage reduction to all allied champions within [1] . This was later scrapped and reverted [2] .
