Swallowed units are rendered vanished and cannot perform any actions. If the target is an ally, they become displacement immune while swallowed. If the target is an enemy, they are instantly stunned for 0. 5 seconds and suppressed for the cast time and while swallowed. Tahm Kench can swallow a target enemy champion for up to 2 seconds if they have three An Acquired Taste stacks, doing so consumes all of them. If Tahm Kench swallows a champion, he becomes unable to cast movement spells and is slowed by 95% for the duration. Swallowing an enemy refunds 50% of Devour's cooldown and mana cost . After 1 second, Devour can be recast into Regurgitate while Tahm Kench's belly is full, and automatically does so at the end of the duration. Allied champions can exit at will by inputting a movement command after the same delay, unless they're immobilized .

Abyssal Voyage Abyssal Voyage COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 140 / 130 / 120 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 2500 / 5500 / 8500 Active: Tahm Kench channels for up to 6 seconds, highlighting the path to his intended destination to allied champions while opening his maw to offer up to one of them the chance to come with him. Abyssal Voyage can be recast after 0. 25 seconds during the channel. If an ally has climbed in, they immediately become untargetable and Tahm Kench automatically begins a 1. 65 -second channel that, when completed, renders Tahm Kench also untargetable and causes him and his ally to blink to the target location, both becoming unable to perform actions for 1 second and afterwards becoming targetable again. Recast: Tahm Kench manually begins the channel to blink to the target location. Allies can still join him while they have the chance during this time. Abyssal Voyage is put on a 10 second cooldown if the second channel is not started or is interrupted . Allies must be out of combat with enemy champions and cannot be affected by their crowd control effects within the last 5 seconds to come with Tahm Kench . Abyssal Voyage cannot be cast while Devour is active. "Boy, the world's one river, and I'm its king. Ain't no place I ain't been; ain't no place I can't go again."
