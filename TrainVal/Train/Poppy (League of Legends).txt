After it hits, the buckler then falls to a location near the target over 1 second, landing and remaining there for up to 4 seconds. Poppy can move over the buckler to retrieve it, gaining a shield for 13 / 15. 5 / 18% (based on level) of her maximum health for 3 seconds. If the buckler kills the target, or if the target is already dead when the buckler hits it, the buckler will bounce back to Poppy instead of falling. Enemy champions can move over the buckler to destroy it. Link ▶️ "Shield to the face!"

Against monsters , the damage based on their health ratio is capped. Physical Damage: 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 (+ 90% bonus AD) (+ 9% of target's maximum health) Capped Monster Health Damage: 30 / 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 Maximum Monster Damage: 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270 (+ 90% bonus AD) The impact creates a field for 1 second that slows enemies within, which then ruptures to deal the same physical damage . Slow: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% Total Physical Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 180% bonus AD) (+ 18% of target's maximum health) Total Maximum Monster Damage: 140 / 240 / 340 / 440 / 540 (+ 180% bonus AD) Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Not Blocked Spell shields will block only a single instance of damage. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Edit Steadfast Presence Steadfast Presence COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 400 Passive: Poppy increases her total armor and total magic resistance by 12%, doubled to 24% while she is below 40% maximum health . Active: Poppy gains 40% bonus movement speed and creates an aura around herself for 2 seconds, causing all enemies who attempt to dash into or within it to be dealt magic damage and knocked up for 0. 5 seconds. If a target was successfully interrupted, they become grounded and slowed by 25% for 2 seconds. Magic Damage: 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+ 70% AP) Steadfast Presence can only block a single dash per enemy per cast. Link ▶️ "No getting through me." Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Steadfast Presence does not stop dashes if the unit is crowd control immune , displacement immune , untargetable , or protected by spell shield in the process (e.g. Death Mark , Stormbringer , Unstoppable Force ). Dashes when the unit is crowd control immune or displacement immune still trigger the aura and take the damage, but do not get knocked up and thus also never become grounded and slowed . Spell shields deny all the effects if Steadfast Presence is triggered by their holder, and are consumed in the process. Being untargetable prevents Steadfast Presence from triggering, but this does not prevent it from triggering against another, targetable dash. Steadfast Presence does not trigger against lunges . Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 26 / 23. 5 / 21 / 18. 5 / 16 seconds. Edit Heroic Charge Heroic Charge COST: 70 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 475 Active: Poppy dashes to the target enemy's location. If they are in range upon arrival, she deals physical damage and carries them along with her for up to 400 units. Physical Damage: 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 (+ 50% bonus AD) If the target hits terrain, she stops to deal the same physical damage again and stuns them for a duration. Stun Duration: 1. 6 / 1. 7 / 1. 8 / 1. 9 / 2 Total Physical Damage: 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 / 280 (+ 100% bonus AD) Hide Details Tips & Tricks Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Poppy will be ordered to basic attack the target. Heroic Charge can apply spell effects twice (once when Poppy hits her target and once she stuns them against a wall). Both instances of damage and crowd control are all the same cast instance . Effects that only trigger once per spell cast will not trigger twice. Poppy dashes slightly less far than the distance she pushes the target. Heroic Charge can interact with player-generated terrain . The dash does not follow targets. The target's position at the time of Heroic Charge's cast is the direction Poppy will dash towards. Poppy does not carry nor deal damage to the target if they have left a certain radius before she collides with them. Tips & Tricks Heroic Charge can traverse terrain, provided that the target is within range. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 21 / 19. 5 / 18 / 16. 5 / 15 seconds. Edit Keeper's Verdict Keeper's Verdict COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 140 / 120 / 100 CAST TIME: 0. 25 / 0. 35 RANGE: 500 / 850 − 1200 (based on channel time) EFFECT RADIUS: 180 / 225 WIDTH: 180 SPEED: 2500 Active: Poppy charges while being slowed by 15% for up to 4 seconds to increase Keeper's Verdict's range and knock back distance over 0. 5 seconds after the first 0. 5 seconds of the channel. Keeper's Verdict can be recast within the duration. Recast: Poppy releases the charge to launch her hammer upwards, dealing physical damage to enemies nearby and in an area in front of her and knocking them up for 1 second. Physical Damage: 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 45% bonus AD) If Keeper's Verdict was charged for at least 0. 5 seconds, it deals 100% increased damage and enemies hit are knocked back up-to 3400 units toward the enemy team's fountain . Additionally, if no enemies are hit in front of Poppy , she sends a shockwave that travels in the target direction until it collides with an enemy champion, which causes a hammer to erupt. Targets hit by the shockwave or the eruption receive the charged effects. Increased Damage: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 90% bonus AD) If the charge is interrupted or completes without reactivation, Keeper's Verdict is cancelled and the ability is put on a 15-second cooldown. Enemies knocked airborne are revealed and are rendered untargetable while being displaced if Keeper's Verdict was charged for more than 0. 5 seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto / Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Disruption Blocked Blocked Interrupted During the Recast's cast time, Poppy's Flash is sealed . The erupting hammer of the charged cast that sends out a missile will be centered on the first champion struck, not at the location the missile collided with them. Enemies within the enemy team's fountain (at least 400 units away from the center of the fountain ) that are hit by a Keeper's Verdict that would knock them back are instead knocked up for 0. 75 seconds and not rendered untargetable , like the uncharged effect. They still receive the full damage. Keeper's Verdict does not destroy in-flight projectiles for enemies hit if they are rendered untargetable . The knock back will only displace enemies as far as they can go (e.g. to the furthest current spot available of Realm of Death's and The Hextech Ultimatum's borders and to the corner of the fountain). The displacement's duration will remain unchanged regardless of if the knock back cannot achieve its full distance due to the affected target being restricted by boundaries they are unable to cross. In order for this to be possible, the speed of the knock back is decreased (based on where the actual landing point is) to match the amount of distance covered to time spent displaced. Keeper's Verdict's airborne debuff is non-dispellable and thus cannot be removed by cleansing effects. The debuff will remove itself automatically when the forced movement ends.

Poppy is the first and so far only post-launch champion to be priced at 1350 on release (all other champions with the same price were already present when the game officially launched in October 2009). Poppy is one of two champions that went into the weekly champion rotation on the day of their release. The other one is Udyr . Of all champion updates in the game, Poppy has gone the longest without an update to her base splash art prior to her VGU in 2015 . Poppy, Keeper of the Hammer Poppy is the first champion with full facial animation. Poppy is the first champion to receive splash updates to all skins. Future champion reworks/updates have since followed this tradition. The splash art features the titular flower . Poppy's theme resembles Demacia Rising ( instruments used include a low brass and a flute ). Poppy's dance references the Grunka Lunka's dance from Futurama . [2] A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Poppy was initially going to wear a red scarf as a 'heroic thing', it competed heavily with her pigtails and was deemed way too busy on her model, the scarf was trimmed down to a muffler. Poppy's favorite food / candy is the lollipop . Poppy finds Yordles 'too fluffy' and disorganized, herself preferring the orderliness found in Demacia . Poppy is the first champion to have a form of crowd control in all of her abilities. Poppy is the first and only champion to have two skins released for the Snowdown Showdown event.
