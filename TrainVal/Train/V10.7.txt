Client Bug Fix: Fixed an issue causing the "Send Friend Request" button to become non-functional in custom lobbies. Bug Fix: The "View Schedule" information screen no longer appears blurry when viewing upcoming tournaments in the Clash hub. Ranked We'll be attempting to make sure that when one team in a Solo/Duo game has a duo, the other team should have one as well. This change will only be applying to Ranked Solo/Duo for right now. We'll be looking into adding it to Flex and Normal games, but since premades can be of all different sizes in those modes, making them equivalent across teams can be much more complicated. Once we've had a chance to see these changes live, we'll try to expand to queues with different group sizes.
