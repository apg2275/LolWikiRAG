It is available only on Summoner's Rift . The holder of the buff is marked by swirling blue runes around the champion. How to obtain [ ] By landing the killing blow to the Blue Sentinel . By picking up a wisp of the buff at the Blue Sentinel's camp location. This wisp is spawned when the Blue Sentinel is killed in its Draconic form and lasts for 60 seconds. The monster gains this Draconic form after the map transforms into the Elemental Rift . The wisp can be picked up by one of the killer's allied champions depending on if they had Smite or not. If they did, then the wisp can be picked up by one of their allies. Otherwise, it can only be picked up by an ally that has Smite . By being alive when the Blue Sentinel is slain by your allies in its Voidborn form. The monster becomes corrupted by the Void after Baron Nashor spawns at 20 minutes into the game, turning into a Voidborn that empowers the Crest of Insight to be granted to both the killer and all their allied champions if they are alive. By killing a champion that possesses this buff; it is transferred and the duration of the buff is refreshed. This transfer only occurs if the buff was initially obtained from a non- Voidborn Blue Sentinel .
