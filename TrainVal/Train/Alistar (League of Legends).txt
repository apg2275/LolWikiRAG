He generates 7 stacks if a nearby enemy champion or epic monster dies. At 7 stacks, Alistar consumes them all to heal himself for 5% of his maximum health and nearby allied champions for 7% of his maximum health . Triumphant Roar can occur only once every few seconds, though Alistar may still generate stacks before then. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Counters Projectile See Notes If Alistar is at 7 stacks when Triumphant Roar comes off cooldown, he will roar as soon as it elapses. Alistar does not gain stacks for unsuccessfully trying to apply crowd control , for instance against a crowd control immune target. Alistar will still gain a stack for unsuccessfully trying to knock back a champion protected by a spell shield with Headbutt . (bug) Healing occurs simultaneously for Alistar and his allies. There is a VFX projectile (700 missile speed) that cannot be destroyed by Wind Wall and is unrelated to the actual heal. Alistar loses all Triumph stacks upon dying.

Magic Damage: 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 80% AP) Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Pulverize can be buffered during Headbutt to cast with reduced cast time when the dash ends. Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Alistar_Q_Video.webm Edit Headbutt Headbutt COST: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 650 SPEED: 1200 / 1544 / ∞ Active: Alistar dashes to the target enemy's location. If they are within 400 units upon arrival, he deals them magic damage and knocks them back 700 units over 0. 5 seconds while also stunning them for 0. 75 seconds. Magic Damage: 55 / 110 / 165 / 220 / 275 (+ 100% AP) Hide Details Tips & Tricks Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted The dash speed depends on the inverse of the distance to the target: If Alistar's radius overlaps with his target's, he will dash with 1200 speed . If Alistar is further from his target than the previous condition, he will dash with (1200  ×  dash distance) / (dash distance - sum of radiuses). At maximum target range, against an enemy with a 65 gameplay radius (median of all champions), Alistar will dash with 1544 speed (reaching his target within 0. 429 seconds ). Both the lower the dash distance and the larger Alistar and/or his target, the faster the dash becomes; this scales hyperbolically. When Pulverize is buffered during the dash, the knockback distance is reduced to 200 units. The CC duration of the ability can be reduced by up to 33.33% Tenacity , due to airborne not being reducible while the stun is. The knockback direction is in a straight line from Alistar's original location at start of cast and the enemy when Alistar's dash ends. Headbutt can knock enemies through terrain. The knockback stops short on walls that cannot be surpassed but the disable duration is not changed. The spell indicator for this ability also displays the direction for the knock back relative to Alistar's position. Alistar's attack range is reduced 「 to -375 」 「 by 500 」 during Headbutt , to prevent him from being able to attack the target when he completes the dash. Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the stun . Tips & Tricks Headbutt may be used as a gap-closer to knock up enemies at the target location with Pulverize , additionally overriding Headbutt's knock back . Map-Specific Differences Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit Stun now ends at the same time the displacement does. Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 26 / 23. 5 / 21 / 18. 5 / 16 seconds. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Alistar_W_Video.webm Edit Trample Trample COST: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana COOLDOWN : 12 / 11. 5 / 11 / 10. 5 / 10 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 350 Active: Alistar tramples the ground around him every 0. 5 seconds over 5 seconds, becoming ghosted and dealing magic damage to nearby enemies. Each time this damages at least one enemy champion, he generates a stack of Trample that lasts for the remaining duration, stacking up to 5 times. Magic Damage Per Tick: 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20 (+ 7% AP) Total Magic Damage: 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 70% AP) At 5 stacks, Alistar's next basic attack against a champion within 6 seconds is empowered to deal 20 − 275 (based on level) bonus magic damage and stun the target for 1 second. This will end Trample prematurely. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Magic Counters Spell shield Parries See Notes See Notes Trample deals persistent area damage damage around Alistar , while the bonus damage on the resulting attack is proc damage . The stun and bonus damage are blocked by spell shields but the base attack damage is not. The on-hit effect is consumed if the attack blocked , but not if it is dodged or missed while Alistar is blinded . In all cases, the attack's effects are negated as normal. As it is an on-hit effect, the bonus damage and stun can be applied by Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit.

Alistar is an alternative form of Alistair , the Anglicized form of Scottish Gaelic Alasdair , ultimately from Ancient Greek Ἀλέξανδρος, meaning "Defender": from PIE roots *h₂lek- "to ward off, to defend" and *h₂nḗr "man" [2] During Alpha Test , he was simply called 'Minotaur'. Alistar was deemed overpowered/obnoxious in the Ultra Rapid Fire game mode (available in April 2014) and was ultimately disabled in non-custom games. Alistar's Series 1 Eternals make the following references: By the Horns references the phrase take the bull by the horns . Indomita-Bull is a pun on the words "indomitable" and "bull". Matador is another term for bullfighter .
