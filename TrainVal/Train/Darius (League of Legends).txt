Hemorrhage can be applied to and refreshed against shielded targets. Hemorrhage can also be applied on-hit , but will specifically not do so if the target is invulnerable.

Physical Damage: 140 / 145 / 150 / 155 / 160% AD If this attack kills the target, half of Crippling Strike's cooldown is reduced and its mana cost is refunded.

Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Darius_WVideo.ogv Edit Apprehend Apprehend COST: 70 / 60 / 50 / 40 / 30 mana COOLDOWN: 24 / 21. 5 / 19 / 16. 5 / 14 CAST TIME: 0. 25 EFFECT RADIUS: 535 ANGLE: 50° Passive: Darius gains armor penetration . Armor Penetration: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% Active: Darius sweeps his axe in a cone in the target direction, granting sight of the area for 1 second while pulling enemies hit towards him. Upon arrival, they rebound 150 units off of him, remaining airborne and becoming slowed by 40% for 1 second. Darius is unable to move or cast Decimate or Noxian Guillotine for 0. 4 seconds after Apprehend's cast time. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Not Blocked Enemies hit by Apprehend will quickly be dragged to Darius before rebounding over a longer period. The slow duration starts as soon as the target rebounds off of Darius . PENDING FOR TEST: : The rebound location is determined when the target reaches Darius' location. The rebound's forced movement's duration is roughly 0. 5 seconds, finishing before the airborne duration ends. PENDING FOR TEST: : There is no stun applied for the same duration of the airborne , meaning brittle cannot extend the disable duration. It will not increase the slow duration in most situations because of the negative tenacity falling off before the slow is applied. After the pull, Darius will attempt to basic attack the closest pulled target, prioritizing enemy champions. The armor penetration stacks multiplicatively with other forms of percentage armor penetration . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

He can also recast the ability within 20 seconds at no cost, which refreshes on further executions. At rank 3, Noxian Guillotine has no mana cost and recast timer.

Noxian Guillotine applies Hemorrhage after the damage. Darius will only leap towards the target if it is at range, or leap backwards if it is very close. This leap can pass very thin terrain and will otherwise not be able to. In any case, Darius will still hit the target. The ability is disabled while grounded or rooted even if Darius is in the range in which he does not leap. Noxian Guillotine will not reset nor trigger Noxian Might if used to kill a clone or a target protected by resurrection . Noxian Guillotine will reset but not trigger Noxian Might if it finishes off a target that is in a zombie state . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

File:Darius PorcelainCircle.png Original View in 3D 880 22.05.2012 There is no greater symbol of Noxian might than Darius, the nation’s most feared and battle-hardened leader. Rising from humble origins to become the Hand of Noxus, he cleaves through the empire’s enemies—many of them Noxians themselves. Knowing that he never doubts his cause is just, and never hesitates once his axe is raised, those who stand against the commander of the Trifarian Legion can expect no mercy.

Darius - Draven is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being Cassiopeia - Katarina , Kayle - Morgana , Garen - Lux , Nasus - Renekton , Yasuo - Yone , and Vi - Jinx ). Though not a pair, Anivia , Ornn , and Volibear are also siblings. Darius is 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 meters) tall and weighs 266 lbs (121 kilograms). [2] Darius was the first champion to have an autonomous Recall / Teleport animation. He and his brother Draven are the first related champions to be released back to back. Darius was the first champion to receive Chroma packs for 2 of his skins, namely Classic and Dunkmaster . Tahm Kench says Darius' strength is 'waning' and that he could 'help him slow time's regress'. This and the strands of gray hair on his head suggest Darius either is of advanced age or ages prematurely after years of exertion & combat stress. Darius is Latin transliteration, through Greek Δαρεῖος, of Old Persian Dāray auš "Upholder of Good". [3] [4] His new background references Darius I . [5] By coincidence, Dar ius shares PIE root *dʰer- with Dar ha , the birth name of Karma in her updated lore. [6] Darius' abilities had different names during development: Hemorrhage used to have a movement speed buff called Aggression . It read: "The carnage of war enlivens Darius, increasing his movement speed." Hamstring / Noxian Tactics Sudden Death Noxian Might was originally called Blood Rage but was renamed by player request to better reflect his personality.
