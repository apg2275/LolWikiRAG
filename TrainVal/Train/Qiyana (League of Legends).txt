The windblast creates a cascading shockwave across any River or Brush it passes through, as well as around the borders of Terrain it reaches, dealing physical damage to enemies hit, stunning them for 0. 5 − 1 (based on proximity) seconds, and briefly granting sight of the area along its path.

The shockwave grants sight along each part of its path for 0. 75 seconds. Artificial terrain (e.g, Anivia's Crystallize , Taliyah's Weaver's Wall , Trundle's Pillar of Ice ) touching map terrain will be treated as a single piece of terrain, even when bridging two pieces of map terrain together; the shockwave will wrap around all connecting terrain. The shockwave's path is determined once it initially spreads; any expired terrain will be treated as if it were still there. Projectile-intercepting effects will block the windblast but not the shockwave. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Qiyana dabs if she uses any emote within 10 seconds of a takedown. [2] Qiyana is the strongest among the 10 sisters and this might be referring to '1v9,’ a common player term used when both having bad teammates and enemies.
