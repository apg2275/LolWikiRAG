League of Legends V1.0.0.152 [ ] Champions [ ] Nami, the Tidecaller Released December 7 Surging Tides (Innate) Allied champions hit by Nami's abilities have their movement speeds increased for a short duration. Aqua Prison (Q) Nami sends a bubble of water into the air to a targeted location that deals magic damage and stuns enemies hit by the bubble. Ebb and Flow (W) Unleashes a surge of water that can target an enemy or allied champion. The water can bounce from champion to champion and deals magic damage to enemy champions and heals allied champions. Tidecaller's Blessing (E) Nami buffs an allied champion, adding extra magic damage and a slow to their attacks. Tidal Wave (Ultimate) Nami summons a massive Tidal Wave from her position. The wave knocks enemies hit into the air, deals magic damage and slows all enemy units it passes through.
