Hotkeys and Commands Menu Hotkeys are keys or key combinations that can be used in matches to perform actions quickly. Commands are strings of text that perform an action when typed in the chat console within a match, or in other PVP.net chat windows. Some commands, like champion laughter, jokes, or dances, only work within a match. Most hotkeys can be configured in the hotkeys section of the game settings. This article lists the default keys.

For players in the AIR client, this process is as simple as opening a chat window through your buddy list. Players in-game will be able to send messages to players in the PvP.net client, or even in other games of League of Legends by making use of the following chat commands, followed by a message: Command Description /w or /msg "summoner name" Will send a message to another player. Summoner names are case sensitive. /r or /reply Will send a message to the last player who sent you a message. Note that it will automatically add the recipient after /r . /all Will send a message to all players in the current match (useful if you forgot to press shift + enter). PvP.net provides players with the ability to block unwanted messages from other players through the use of the following commands: Command Description /mute "summoner name" Will mute all text from a player for the duration of your current game session. /mute all Will mute all text from all players for the duration of your current game session. /ignore "summoner name" Will mute a player during this game session and all subsequent game sessions. /ignore all Will mute all players during this game session and all subsequent game sessions. /fullmute "summoner name" Will mute all text and pings from a player for the duration of your current game session. /fullmute all Will mute all text and pings from all players for the duration of your current game session. /muteself Will mute all text and pings from you for the duration of your current game session and notify allies of your communication opt-out. /deafen Will mute all text and pings from all players (including yourself) for the duration of your current game session and notify allies of your communication opt-out. File Location for Keybindings [ ] "Time doesn't heal all wounds." This article is outdated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. This article was last edited by Terrinice on 15-Apr-2023 19:37 . "Would it help if I apologized?" Please read this section completely if you want to change this file. It can mess up your keybindings if not done properly and it is wise to test the changes in a tutorial game before using them in a real game... ALWAYS BACK UP THE FILE! The file that holds the keybindings can be found here: \League of Legends\Config\input.ini Some people have trouble changing the keybindings through the in-game interface. Editing this file is an alternate way of changing your keybindings. In particular, the game UI forbids assigning Shift modified key-bindings to the basic champion abilities, so editing the file is the only way to achieve this. If the file does not exist it means that you have not changed your keybindings yet. If so, you can make a new file in the aforementioned folder and name it input.ini , although it is recommended that you go into a practice game and modify some keybindings instead so you can be sure you're editing the correct file. Another thing to note is that Riot Games Inc. often changes the method for changing these settings. According to Riot support, current to patch V6.13 , these are the steps required to modify keybindings through the input.ini file. Launch League and Login Start a Custom Game Minimize the game and Navigate to \League of Legends\Config Delete PersistedSettings.json Open and edit the lines you need to in game.cfg (this file contain most non-input settings) or input.ini in Notepad Quit Custom Game Start new Custom Game to verify changes If this does not work, repeat the process; except before exiting the game, in the input.ini file's preferences, mark it as read only to prevent any errors (this may be undone later). This list means calls for the edits must be carried out in a custom game. Persons editing setting this way should be aware that if connectivity drops; the game kicks you for afk; or the game client crashes while modifying the input.ini , any saved changes to the input.ini file will not be overwritten, but they will not be properly transcribed to the PersistedSettings.json file where they need to be in order to take affect on the next launch. You will have to start from the beginning of the process, including opening and saving the input.ini (even if no further changes need made). Below is a list of the items that can be changed. Be aware that the header shown in bold MUST be present. Also, it is not necessary to include all items, just the ones you want to change. So for example if you want to switch around the smartcast and normal cast keybindings, you just use the evtCastSpell1 through evtCastAvatarSpell2 section and the evtSmartCastSpell1 through the evtSmartCastAvatarSpell2 section. Any items not explicitly mentioned use the default values listed above. Code [GameEvents] evtCastSpell1=[q]

evtUseItem6 = [Shift][6] As of the Skarner patch ( V1.0.0.123 ), there is now a new keybinding available: Smart + Self Cast . This new setup is nearly identical to the old smartcast except in one regard: spells that you can target on yourself you can now cast to yourself by pressing the key with the mouse over any invalid target. For example, with this setup you can apply Morgana's Black Shield to yourself by pressing the self + smartcast key and having your mouse over anything that is not an allied champion. For those of you who want to edit the input.ini file, here is an example of self + smartcast applied to the standard keys: Code [GameEvents] 
evtSmartPlusSelfCastSpell4 = [r]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastSpell3 = [e]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastSpell2 = [w]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastSpell1 = [q]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastAvatarSpell1 = [d]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastAvatarSpell2 = [f]

evtCastSpell4 = [r][Shift]
evtCastSpell3 = [e][Shift]
evtCastSpell2 = [w][Shift]
evtCastSpell1 = [q][Shift]
evtCastAvatarSpell1 = [d][Shift]
evtCastAvatarSpell2 = [f][Shift] Switching primary and secondary mouse buttons [ ] LoL does not support the setting within operating systems that switch primary and secondary buttons, nor does it allow the changing of these within the in-game client. To switch these buttons you must use the following steps for modding the input.ini. Code [GameEvents] 
evtPlayerSelectClick = [Button 1] 
evtPlayerMoveClick = [Button 2]

evntPlayerPing=[alt][Button 2]

evtOrbitCamera = [Ctrl][Button 2] Patch History [ ] V6.12 : The protocol for manually editing the input.ini file was changed many times and the page had not kept up with the information. The information on this page was updated to Riots current verified step-by-step process. It is unknown which patch the system was implemented during, except that it was "recent" according to a support staffers response. The information, while current to the patch is very likely to change. V3.14 : Trinkets were added evtUseVisionItem was created and set to [4] evtUseItem(4, 5, and 6) were displaced to [5, 6, and 7] respectively. V1.0.0.145 : Default hotkeys for joke, taunt, dance, and laugh have been changed. Joke changed to Ctrl+1 from Shift+1. Taunt changed to Ctrl+2 from Shift+2. Dance changed to Ctrl+3 from Shift+3. Laugh changed to Ctrl+4 from Shift+4. V1.0.0.138 : Minion health bar toggle is now bound to Ctrl+L by default, instead of L. V1.0.0.136 : Fixed a bug where Ctrl+F didn't display a Ping/FPS overlay. V1.0.0.126 : Fixed a bug in which the Show/Hide HUD keybinding would always be F5, despite the selection in the options menu. V1.0.0.124 : Added a new ping functionality: you can now ping to signal your teammates to fall back. V1.0.0.123 : Added new keybindings for "Self+Smart cast" for abilities and Summoner Spells. Casting with these binds will first try to smart cast the ability; if there is no target or an invalid target under the cursor, it will attempt to self-cast the ability. V1.0.0.99 : Added two ignore options: "/ignore ally" for ignoring the allied team, and "/ignore enemy" for ignoring the enemy team. V1.0.0.98 : Smart cast now defaults to Shift and self cast now defaults to Alt. These can be changed in the keybinding menu. V1.0.0.97 : Mouse wheel scrolling on the minimap is now disabled by default. V1.0.0.86 : Right-clicking an allied portrait will no longer move you in the direction of your ally. Ignoring or muting a user will now also ignore their minimap pings. V1.0.0.83 : The HUD can now be hidden using Alt+[-]. Responding using the "/r" function will now correctly respond to the most recent person that whispered you. The mouse wheel can now be used to scroll up and down in the shop. V1.0.0.79 : The level up spell hotkey has been changed to holding down Ctrl while pressing the spell hotkey (Q, W, E, R). It is no longer Alt. This can be changed in the keybinding menu. Holding down Alt and pressing a spell hotkey will now cast the spell on yourself if it is self-castable, or cast the spell under your mouse cursor if applicable. This is referred to as "Smart Casting" and can be rebound in the keybinding menu. F1-F5 keys can now be used to cast spells on yourself or your allies. Click the spell, then use one of the F1 (self) through F5 buttons (allies). F1-F5 keys can now be clicked or held down to center the camera on yourself or allies. V1.0.0.75 : Pressing Esc should now deselect a controlled pet. V1.0.0.74 : "/help" can now also be accessed with "/?". "/surrender" can now also be accessed with "/ff". "/nosurrender" can now also be accessed with "/noff". "/w" can now also be accessed with "/msg". Fixed an issue that was causing "/r" to incorrectly remember the last person who whispered you. V1.0.0.138 : Minion health bar toggle is now bound to Ctrl+L by default instead of L. V1.0.0.123 : Added new keybindings for "Self+Smart Cast" for abilities and Summoner spells. Casting with these binds will first try to Smart-Cast the ability; if there is no target or an invalid target under the cursor, it will attempt to Self-Cast the ability. V1.0.0.52 : Fixed a bug where the Hold key (H) was stopping move abilities like Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab . V1.0.0.32 : Added chat commands: "/r" replies to the last person who whispered you. "/mute <player>" will block all in-game chat from that player. V0.9.25.24 : Added "stop command" and bound it to V. Holding down H works like the stop command until the key is released.
