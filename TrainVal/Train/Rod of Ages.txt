Upon reaching maximum stacks, gain a level that preserves your current experience (cap remains at level 18) and increase all effects of Eternity by 50%. Strategy Rod of Ages is best used by champions that can make use of the large stat increases by scaling with them effectively (usually mana). Rod of Ages is often the item that is built the first by its users due to wanting to stack up its passive as early as possible into the game. This is because the stats the item grants by itself along with the stacks are highly valuable, especially in the early game. Having the item as part of one's build is too high of an investment since it takes a total of 10 minutes for it to reach its full potential, so it must be prioritized as a rush item so that it achieves that power spike sooner than later. Rod of Ages also provides a slight amount of sustain with its other passive which recovers both health and mana. Old icons 1st version Trivia Rod of Ages may have been originally named as "Guinsoo's Rod of Oblivion", and its icon is still named as such in the League of Legends install directory. Karthus Lightsbane uses the Rod of Ages . The name is likely a reference to Def Leppard's 1983 song "Rock of Ages". (The movie of the same name, which is also named after the song, was not released until 3 years after the item came out.) The Quick Charge version is also used on the Crystal Scar during Rotating Game Modes . The name of its Masterwork item on PBE during the Preseason 2023 cycle was Scepter of Eternity .
