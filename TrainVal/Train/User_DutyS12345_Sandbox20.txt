He equips two weapons at any one time, one as his main weapon and one as his off-hand . Each weapon has a unique basic attack and passive effect. Aphelios begins the game with Calibrum as his main weapon and Severum in his off-hand , with Gravitum , Infernum , and Crescendum queued in reserve. The queue order can be rearranged based on weapon usage. Innate - Moonlight: Weapons spawn with 50 Moonlight for ammunition , which is consumed on basic attacks on-attack or to cast his abilities . Abilities that cause Aphelios to attack do not cost additional Moonlight on top of their ability cost. Once his main weapon is exhausted of Moonlight , it is moved to the end of the queue and Aphelios assembles his next available weapon over 1 second to equip it from his reserve, with its ability being placed on a 1. 5 -second cooldown before that time. Aphelios cannot cast Phase during the assembly. Innate - Weapon Master: Aphelios cannot improve his abilities with skill points . He starts the game with Phase and gains access to abilities at level 2 and Moonlight Vigil at level 6, with the latter improving automatically at levels 11 and 16. Instead, Aphelios may spend his skill points to gain bonus attack damage , bonus attack speed or lethality . Bonus Attack Damage: 4. 5 / 9 / 13. 5 / 18 / 22. 5 / 27 Bonus Attack Speed: 9 / 18 / 27 / 36 / 45 / 54% Lethality: 5. 5 / 11 / 16. 5 / 22 / 27. 5 / 33 Link ▶️ "This will be your voice."

Assigning points does not follow the same rules as conventional point expenditure. The quickest you can get an individual statistic to rank-6 is by assigning points at 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 7 / 9. An ammunition counter will appear to the right side of the screen at 10 or less Moonlight . Abilities can still be used with less than the required amount of Moonlight , consuming all remaining Moonlight in the process. Runaan's Hurricane does not consume additional Moonlight for his basic attacks. The icon for this ability changes based on the active skin and functions as Alune's portrait, similarly to Aphelios' portrait. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Weapon ammunition changed to 30.

The individual actives do not share a cooldown. Edit Calibrum, the Sniper Rifle COST: 1 Moonlight per attack Aphelios gains 100 bonus attack range while Calibrum is his main weapon . Enemies damaged by Calibrum through an ability are marked for 4. 5 seconds, revealing them for the duration. Aphelios' next basic attack against a marked target uses the current off-hand weapon and has 1800 range , increased missile speed, and a brief cast time that lasts shorter based on Aphelios' proximity to the target. The empowered attack will consume the marks from all targets, dealing 15 (+ 20% bonus AD) bonus physical damage to the main target for each mark consumed. If Calibrum is the current off-hand weapon, the main weapon is used for the attack instead. Link ▶️ "Calibrum."

The increased basic attack range is drawn for Aphelios to differentiate it from his normal attack range. The empowered range for the mark will also be drawn as an indicator for Aphelios . Runaan's Hurricane bolts will use Calibrum's projectiles for Aphelios's attacks with Calibrum . If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the empowered attack's cast time, it will still fire despite the target being invalid.

Severum's attacks heal Aphelios for 2% − 7. 1 % (based on level) of the post-mitigation damage dealt, increased to 5% − 17. 75 % (based on level) for attacks from abilities. Healing from Severum in excess of Aphelios' maximum health is converted into a shield for an amount of up to 10 − 140 (based on level) (+ 6% maximum health) , lingering for up to 30 seconds.

Attacks alternate between Severum and his current off-hand weapon, each dealing 10 − 40 (based on level) (+ 20% − 35% (based on level) bonus AD) physical damage , affected by critical strike modifiers, and applying on-hit damage at 25% effectiveness.

Crescendum will not deal damage if blocked by Wind Wall , but the stacks will still be gained. Cosmetically, the Moonlight cost is consumed through the duration.

Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Notes No compensations are made if Binding Eclipse is used to empower in-flight Gravitum projectiles that are destroyed or have the slow application negated by any means, wasting the effect in the process.

Edit Infernum, the Flamethrower COST: 1 Moonlight per attack Basic attacks with Infernum shoot a fire bolt that upon arrival splits into a cone of 4 lesser bolts behind the target, dealing damage to enemies they pass through. The fire bolt deals 110% AD physical damage to the primary target. Secondary targets hit by any bolt are dealt 82. 5 / 110% (based on level) AD physical damage , reduced to 25. 3 / 33% (based on level) AD against minions .

After 0. 25 seconds, Aphelios then fires a volley of attacks at each locked-on target from his current off-hand weapon, dealing 100% AD physical damage and applying on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness. The damage is affected by critical strike modifiers. There is no range limit for locked-on targets.
