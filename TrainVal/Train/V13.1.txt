New Ranked rewards have been added throughout climbing progress. These are earned through obtaining Split Points by completing games. 10 Split Points are earned for a win, reduced to 6 points for a loss. The Ranked skin for Split 1 is earnable by players of all ranks, but the amount of Split Points required varies by rank: 80 points for Gold and above and 1600 points for Silver and below. In addition, once the skin is earned, it remains earned even if demotion was to occur. The skin will be distributed after the end of Season 2023 - Split 1. Promotion Series have been reduced to a best of 3 from a best of 5. The restriction on duoing in Ranked Solo/Duo with an MMR of Masters or above is disabled until V13.3. Note that duo restrictions based on visible rank are still active, so a player who reaches Master or above will not be able to duo. Visible rank is no longer used as matchmaking criteria, only MMR (this was implemented in V12.23). Career stats have been reset for the new ranked season. Customizer Bug Fix: Dropdown functions are now filtered consistently for the Identity Customizer.

However, as a result of this aforementioned complexity, refund tokens will be entirely removed in V13.11. This will bring the refund policy in line with other Riot games, removing the need to maintain an older system just for League. As a result, the base refund policy will shift in patch 13.11 as well. Unused, eligible content will be refundable for up to 14 days from purchase. Tokens will disappear in V13.11 if not used by that date and the refund policy will adjust at the same time.
