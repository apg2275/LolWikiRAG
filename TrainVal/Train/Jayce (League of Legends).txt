Edit Transform Mercury Cannon Transform Mercury Cannon COOLDOWN: 6 CAST TIME: none Active: Jayce transforms into Cannon Stance , receiving access to its abilities , becoming ranged with 500 attack range , and empowering his next basic attack to reduce the target's armor and magic resistance by 10 / 15 / 20 / 25% (based on level) for 5 seconds. Jayce begins the game with Transform but cannot increase its rank. Instead, his basic abilities each have 6 ranks. Link ▶️ "Cannon engaged." Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Counters Parries Blocked Transformations do not count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. The resistance reduction does not apply to structures. Both Transform on-hit effects have no set duration and will only be consumed when Jayce either lands a basic attack or switches stances. The enhanced attack will not be consumed if it is parried ( dodge , block , blind , and Riposte ). The empowered attack will not trigger against structures nor wards . Edit Hextech Capacitor Hextech Capacitor Innate: Whenever Jayce switches between either Hammer Stance or Cannon Stance , he gains ghosting and 40 bonus movement speed for 0. 75 seconds.

Edit Shock Blast Shock Blast COST: 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 Mana COOLDOWN: 8 CAST TIME: 0. 2143 RANGE: 1050 / 1600 EFFECT RADIUS: 175 / 250 / 160 / 250 WIDTH: 140 SPEED: 1450 / 2350 Active: Jayce fires an electric bolt in the target direction that detonates upon hitting an enemy or reaching maximum range, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies and granting sight of the area for 1. 25 seconds. Physical Damage: 55 / 110 / 165 / 220 / 275 / 330 (+ 120% bonus AD) If the bolt passes through Acceleration Gate , it becomes supercharged: increasing its damage by 40% as well as its speed, range and explosion radius. Increased Damage: 77 / 154 / 231 / 308 / 385 / 462 (+ 168% bonus AD) Link ▶️ "Feel the thunder!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Upon touching Acceleration Gate , the enhanced missile gains its remaining range equal to [ 1600 units - travelled distance of the standard missile ]. This means that the range of the enhanced Shock Blast is always the same, regardless of how early or late it interacted with Acceleration Gate . Supercharging the Shock Blast as soon as possible, however, will improve its average speed significantly. For this, Jayce must stand inside or very close to the Acceleration Gate , or place it very close to himself right after Shock Blast's cast time. Shock Blast's effect radius is centered around the location of the missile as it collides. Shock Blast will always damage the enemy it collided with, even if it is so large that it is outside the effect radius. The non-enhanced Shock Blast detonation has a slightly smaller sight radius than the radius in which it deals damage.

Hyper Charge's total damage is affected by critical strike modifiers. Damage Modifier: 70 / 78 / 86 / 94 / 102 / 110% AD Hyper Charge resets Jayce's basic attack timer. Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Physical Counters Parries Blocked The last basic attack is checked on-hit rather than on-attack . If Runaan's Hurricane or Guinsoo's Rageblade hit the target before the basic attack does, the basic attack damage will not be modified. Edit Acceleration Gate Acceleration Gate COST: 50 Mana COOLDOWN: 16 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 650 WIDTH: 750 Active: Jayce deploys an energy gate centered at the target location, lasting for 4 seconds and granting sight of its surroundings. Jayce and all allied champions can move through it to gain bonus movement speed that decays over 3 seconds. Bonus Movement Speed: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55% The buff is continuously refreshed while inside the gate. Acceleration Gate will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location The Gate grants the bonus in an area 750 units wide and 100 units thick.
