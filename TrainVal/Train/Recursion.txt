Contents 1 General 2 Other recursions Recursion describes the interaction of percentage-modifying stacking of champion statistics . To have a recursion you need 2 or more multipliers, each one increasing the other's effect, infinitely but with diminishing returns. General [ ] Recursion formulas are defined by having the base value devided by (1 - the multiplication of the multipliers). For example, if two multipliers (A and B) increase a champion's attack damage , their base formula would either be A D × ( 1 + A ) × ( 1 + B ) {\displaystyle \pagecolor{black}\color{black}AD \times (1 + A) \times (1 + B)} (multiplicative stacking) or A D × ( 1 + A + B ) {\displaystyle \pagecolor{black}\color{black}AD \times (1 + A + B)} (additive stacking). Recursion usually happens for multiplicative stackings, by then dividing the formula, for example, by ( 1 − A × B ) {\displaystyle \pagecolor{black}\color{black}(1 - A \times B)} . In game, recursion happens by default when such stacking occurs, but this is usually considered a bug and individually fixed.

Note, a recursion will not happen if both effects do not interact with each other (e.g Crimson Pact with Rabadon's Deathcap ) or if the stat is gained on cast (e.g Blade of the Exile ).
