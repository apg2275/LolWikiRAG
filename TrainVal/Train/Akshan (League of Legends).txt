If Akshan scores a takedown against a Scoundrel while alive and within 3 seconds of damaging them, he receives an additional 100 and revives all dead allied champions that they have slain after 1 second. When Akshan claims a Scoundrel's bounty he removes the marks of all other enemies. Scoundrels refresh their mark duration on subsequent kills, and will have their mark removed when they die by any means. Akshan cannot mark enemies as Scoundrels while they are dead. Allies are revived at their summoning platform . Active: Akshan enters camouflage , which lasts indefinitely while he is near terrain or inside brush , and for 2 seconds otherwise. During this time. he can see trails leading toward Scoundrels , and while facing them if they are within 5000 units, he gains bonus mana regeneration equal to 12% of his missing mana as well as bonus movement speed . Bonus Movement Speed: 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 / 120 Going Rogue can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically after its duration. Attacking or casting abilities ends Going Rogue immediately.

Enemy champions that kill Akshan will not be marked as Scoundrels nor increase their slay count. Clones do not count for triggering Going Rogue's passive. Going Rogue's buff refreshes to last indefinitely upon moving near terrain or into brush, and will refresh to 2 seconds after leaving near terrain or brush. Allied champions within a zombie state are revived only after the state ends. Akshan can still trigger Going Rogue's passive while he is within a zombie state . Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit Scoundrel duration reduced to 25 seconds. Nexus Blitz differences edit New Effect: During the events of Bardle Royale , URF Deathmatch , and Prize Fight , allied champions that are revived will respawn at the location of their death and with 30% maximum health .

Akshan may input an attack or movement command to use the second and third casts. First Cast: Akshan fires a hook in the target direction that embeds in the first terrain hit, and enters preparation for up to 2. 125 seconds. Heroic Swing's second cast can be used while the hook is attached. If the hook fails to attach or Akshan is moved or becomes immobilized , grounded , or polymorphed within the duration, the preparation will end prematurely, cancelling Heroic Swing in the process. Second Cast: Akshan swings around the terrain in the target direction, stopping upon colliding with an enemy champion or terrain. While swinging, he rapidly fires at the nearest visible enemy to deal them physical damage and apply on-hit effects at 25% effectiveness per shot. Akshan will be knocked down by any immobilizing or polymorphing crowd control during the dash. Physical Damage per Shot: 25 / 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 (+ 17. 5 % bonus AD) × (1 + 0. 3 per 100% bonus attack speed) Third Cast: Akshan ends the swing by jumping to the target location, though not through terrain, and fires one last shot at a nearby visible enemy. Scoring an enemy champion takedown reduces Heroic Swing's current cooldown to 0. 5 seconds. The shots can critically strike for 「 (57. 5 % + 36% ) bonus damage 」 「 90% total critical damage 」 and apply life steal at 100% effectiveness. Avengerang and Going Rogue can be cast during the third cast's dash. Comeuppance can be cast at all points during Heroic Swing, though Akshan cannot fire during the swing while it is active. Akshan prioritizes firing at enemy champions with stacks of Dirty Fighting , then those damaged by his targeted spells in the last 4 seconds, then the nearest enemy. Heroic Swing can be cast during Akshan's other abilities. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Direction / Auto / Location Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Basic damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile See Notes Blocked Blocked Grounded Knockdown See Notes Interrupted Akshan will not stop swinging until his dash is stopped. The swing will end prematurely if the terrain the hook was attached to no longer exists, such as player-generated terrain . Akshan will prioritize firing at enemies he damaged with any unit-targeted ability or spell within the last 4 seconds, such as Comeuppance or Ignite . Heroic Swing grants a buff to Akshan for 2 seconds that indicates and determines the first cast's duration. This buff starts as soon as the ability is cast, and lingers for 0. 125 seconds after it expires. This means the hook can be attached to terrain for longer if it hits it earlier in the duration, and vice versa. If Akshan dashes (excluding second cast's dash) or blinks or becomes affected by immobilization , ground , or polymorph in the duration, the buff is removed immediately , causing the first cast to be lost and cancelling Heroic Swing entirely. Akshan immediately fires one shot at the beginning of his swing, one shot every 0. 231 seconds during the swing, and a final shot while dismounting from the swing. The fire rate is not affected by attack speed . Akshan can fire at any targetable enemy unit excluding structures and jungle plants . Only Heroic Swing's first cast is disabled while grounded or rooted . The third cast is still usable during those effects. Heroic Swing's second and third cast can both be used while silenced . Takedowns against clones do not count for resetting Heroic Swing's cooldown. If a takedown is scored while Heroic Swing is active, the cooldown afterwards will be 0. 5 seconds. Akshan will attempt to basic attack the target he fired at with the last shot after the third cast's dash ends, if there is no other input given. Each shot generates a stack of Conqueror . Spell shield will only block a single shot. The attack speed scaling on the damage of the attacks includes the bonus attack speed gained from Akshan's innate attack speed growth. At level 18, each shot at minimum deals 108. 36 (+ 21. 07 % bonus AD) physical damage. Despite this ability not applying on-attack effects, it does apply Navori Quickblades' Transcendence . (bug) Under certain circumstances, upon attaching the hook to terrain, Akshan will create a particle on the location permanently. (bug) This particle can be attacked by minions. PENDING FOR TEST: Hook range including lollipop against walls, automated attacks range while swinging, final dash distance and speed.

He gradually stores bullets into his weapon over the duration. Maximum Bullets Stored: 5 / 6 / 7 Comeuppance will recast after the duration, or can recast early after 0. 5 seconds. Comeuppance is placed on a 5-second cooldown if the channel is cancelled. Recast: Akshan fires all stored bullets at the target, each briefly granting sight around their trajectory and dealing physical damage to the first enemy hit, increased by 0% − 300% (based on target's missing health) . The shots can hit structures . Minimum Physical Damage per Bullet: 20 / 25 / 30 (+ 10% AD) × (1 + (0. 5 + 0. 2 ) per 100% critical strike chance) Maximum Physical Damage per Bullet: 80 / 100 / 120 (+ 40% AD) × (1 + (0. 5 + 0. 2 ) per 100% critical strike chance) Minimum Charged Physical Damage: 100 / 150 / 210 (+ 50 / 60 / 70% AD) × (1 + (0. 5 + 0. 2 ) per 100% critical strike chance) Damage to target with 67% missing hp: 300 / 450 / 630 (+ 150 / 180 / 210% AD) × (1 + (0. 5 + 0. 2 ) per 100% critical strike chance) Each bullet's damage applies life steal at 100% effectiveness, and executes minions .

A kill threshold will appear on the health bar of the target locked onto during the channel, which increases each time Akshan stores a bullet. If the target's current health falls below the threshold, their health bar will be framed in red. The indicator factors the bonus damage applied by Dirty Fighting as well as damage modifiers and the target's resistances. It also factors the projected increase in the target's missing health , from which each consecutive bullet scales more. It updates dynamically over the channel's duration, reacting to fluctuations of the target's health and damage mitigations. The reveal will linger for 2 seconds after the channel has ended. Spell shield will not prevent the lock-on and will only block a single bullet. Comeuppance will not go on a reduced cooldown if Akshan dies during the channel. Comeuppance will cancel if the target becomes untargetable or dies during the channel. Damage to structures does scale with their missing health .
