Innate - Disc of the Sun: Azir can select a marker to construct the Sun Disc above the ruins after a 0. 5 -second cast time . The Sun Disc will activate after being assembled over 5 seconds. The Sun Disc functions the same as a standard inner turret but deals magic damage , gains 40% AP bonus attack damage , and grants its kill credit to Azir . The Sun Disc's health decays over 45 seconds and loses 100 armor and 100 magic resistance while Azir is not alive or is too far away. Azir cannot construct a Sun Disc with the marker while he is unable to cast abilities. See Pets for more details about the Sun Disc . Link ▶️ "Return!"

They also hit enemies in front of them when they come to a halt. Magic Damage: 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 (+ 35% AP) Enemies hit by subsequent soldiers take no additional damage and are instead slowed by an additional 25% per soldier. Conquering Sands will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Link ▶️ "Conquer!" Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked See Notes Sand Soldiers dash about 50 units further away from Azir than the target location, making them stab targets slightly further away. Sand Soldiers will stop their movement upon colliding with Wind Wall but not with Unbreakable . Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Azir_QVideo.ogv Edit Arise! Arise! COST: 40 / 35 / 30 / 25 / 20 mana + 1 Sand Soldier COOLDOWN: 1. 5 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RECHARGE: 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 TARGET RANGE: 525 TETHER RADIUS: 660 Active: Azir summons a Sand Soldier at the target location that is untargetable , lasts 10 seconds, and grants sight of its surroundings. The Sand Soldier expires twice as fast while within range of an enemy turret , and does so instantly if Azir is too far away. Azir periodically stocks a Sand Soldier , up to a maximum of 2. When Azir declares a basic attack against an enemy in a soldier's attack range , the Sand Soldier attacks in his stead, thrusting their spear in the target's direction to deal magic damage to enemies struck in a line and applying on-hit and on-attack effects against the primary target at 50% effectiveness. Targets hit beyond the closest take 25 / 50 / 75 / 100% (based on level) damage. Subsequent Sand Soldiers against the same target deal 25% damage. Magic Damage: 0 − 77 (based on level) (+ 50 / 67 / 84 / 101 / 118) (+ 55% AP) Sand Soldiers cannot attack structures , wards , nor traps . Arise! will cast at max range if cast beyond that. See Pets for more details about Sand Soldiers . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Area damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked Bypass Not Blocked Nearsighting effects will only allow Azir to perform attacks from soldiers within his own sight radius. Azir must rank Arise! as his first ability, and will do so automatically if he reaches level 2 before ranking an ability. Azir can only command his soldiers to attack if he is able to declare basic attack commands himself, meaning crowd control effects that disable attacking, such as disarm , do not allow him to order his soldiers to attack in his stead. Damage to enemy champions from Sand Soldier stabs will draw minion aggro even if the enemy champion was not the primary target. (bug) Commanding a soldier to attack will trigger on-attack effects, but will not apply any of these effects to the target hit. Sand Soldiers will attack the closest enemy to Azir when using attack move (or A + RMB / Shift + RMB ) or auto-attack . An exclamation mark ( ! ) will appear above the Sand Soldier's head when within the range of an enemy turret . Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit Azir will start the game with one point already ranked in Arise! , allowing him to allocate the other two to his other abilities. Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit Limited to 3 Sand Soldiers active. Charge cooldown set to 4. 8 / 4. 4 / 4 / 3. 6 / 3. 2 seconds. Arena differences edit On-hit and on-attack effectiveness changed to 100%.

Shield Strength: 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+ 60% AP) Magic Damage: 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 40% AP) If Azir dashes into an enemy champion , he stops and gains a charge of Arise! . Azir can cast of any of his abilities during the dash.

Width: 6 / 7 / 8 soldiers Width (charge): 620 / 720 / 820 Width (impassable wall): 750 / 850 / 950 Enemies impacted by the charge are dealt magic damage and knocked away over 1 second to a line 650 units in front of Azir . Magic Damage: 200 / 400 / 600 (+ 75% AP) Upon finishing their charge, the soldiers stand as a wall for 5 seconds, acting as impassible terrain against enemies and granting sight of their surroundings. Azir and his allies can move through these soldiers. Link ▶️ "My soldiers march on!" Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked See Notes The soldier units are spawned only 175 units behind Azir , but do not control the knock back directly. Each comes with a missile that travels the same path and conveys the damage and knockback effect. The furthest area (from 325 to 175 units behind Azir ) is covered by a separate set of missiles with the same effects. All of the soldiers and their missiles will end the charge prematurely when one encounters Wind Wall / Unbreakable / Blade Whirl or upon colliding with terrain that they cannot charge through. The charge starts at 0. 25 seconds into the cast time. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. When the dash of the soldiers comes to a halt, all not-yet-affected enemies on top of the soldiers' landing locations (125 radius) are also knocked back. Emperor's Divide will not be canceled if Azir dies during the cast time. While the soldiers are charging forward, the wall is not impassable terrain. This means enemies that are immune to airborne effects can pass through the wall while its moving. The wall will count as terrain for the purposes of 'into terrain' effects (e.g. Condemn , Dredge Line , Heroic Charge ). This will only affect enemies, allies will pass through the wall in all circumstances, even if knocked into it by an enemy.

Original View in 3D 880 15.09.2014 Azir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud man who stood at the cusp of immortality. His hubris saw him betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an Ascended being of immense power. With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.

He is also the second champion to be unable to rank up a basic ability at Level 1, the first being Zilean . Shurima's Legacy may be referencing the Egyptian solar disc god Aten [2] (depicted as a sphere emanating rays of light each ending with a hand) and titular god of the short-lived monotheistic religion imposed by Pharaoh Akhenaten . His son Tutankhamun later restored the polytheistic religion. Azir's dance references Remember The Time by Michael Jackson . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . If Azir summons Sand Soldiers and then dances, they will follow him and dance all in sync. His soldiers will keep dance in Azir's stead while if the player types '/dance' while Azir is recalling . If enemies cannot see Azir while he dances, his soldiers will not appear to dance to them.
