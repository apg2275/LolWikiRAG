If the charge is interrupted or completes without reactivation, Comet Spear is cancelled and the ability is put on full cooldown but refunds half the mana cost .

The spear's damage is not empowered by Mortal Will , nor increased against enemies below 20% of their maximum health . During the second channel, Pantheon gains a minimum health threshold of 1. Pantheon will instantly die upon reappearing if he reaches this threshold. Abilities that target Pantheon will redirect to the last location. Pinging the ability will inform allies in chat which visible enemy champions are in range of Grand Starfall . Pantheon is considered to be in his original casting position even after leaping, but he will blink to the target location the moment the second channel completes. Using Grand Starfall will inform allies with a ping.

His human name comes from pre-Greek Ἀτρεύς, analyzed by folk-etymology as "untrembling"; based on the name of an Achaean warlord known to the Hittites as Attarsiya . Atreus' friend's name Πύλας Pylas also derives from the pre-Greek architectural term πῠ́λη pylē "gate", from which we have " pylon ".
