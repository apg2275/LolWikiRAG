Similar items Bloodthirster Hextech Gunblade Morellonomicon Notes Will of the Ancients was very useful with ability power -based champions that have abilities requiring health costs (e.g. Mordekaiser ) as the healing could help mitigate these costs. Will of the Ancients and Spirit Visage were a great item combination, as Spirit Visage could further boost Will of the Ancients' healing effect. Cooldown - or energy -based champions, such as Katarina and Kennen , could also make use of Will of the Ancients for the sustainability as they can spam their abilities more willingly than mana -based champions. This item was removed because it was very rarely purchased on most AP champions, since it was better to build other raw AP items to try to burst down an enemy as fast as possible and they didn't had time to sustain. In addition, most AP champions have AoE damage, meaning the sustain was too small to make this item worth purchasing. On the very few champions it was purchased, it was known to cause balancing issues. In particular, Vladimir forced this item to be balanced around his very existence, since he had WotA as his core item and could abuse it very well. No actual replacement to this item has been made ( Vladimir has been reworked and rebalanced around the fact that Will of the Ancients do not exist). However, there are currently two items that come close, named Death's Dance and Hextech Gunblade . The former is an AD item. The latter is an AD / AP hybrid item both heal from any damage source, including true damage ; however, the laterÂ is not abused by AP champions like Vladimir because it is significantly more expensive, has a worse build path for them, has wasted stats for them (like the AD ), and lacks cooldown reduction.
