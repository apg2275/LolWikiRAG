At 5 stacks, or 4 while in brush , her next basic attack consumes all stacks to become a Headshot . Headshot: Caitlyn's basic attack is empowered to have an uncancellable windup and deal 60 / 90 / 120% (based on level) (+ (148. 75 % + 34% ) critical strike chance) AD bonus physical damage , increased to 110 / 115 / 120% (based on level) (+ (148. 75 % + 34% ) critical strike chance) AD against non-champions. Caitlyn may fire more than one Headshot until it hits a target, which consumes all stacks. Enemies that step over a Yordle Snap Trap or are hit by 90 Caliber Net can grant an additional Headshot against them at 1300 range within 1. 8 seconds, without consuming stacks. Each method grants only one Headshot at a time. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Basic damage Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked Blocked Blocked Headshot is consumed when the missile successfully hits the target. If Caitlyn's current target becomes trapped by Yordle Snap Trap or 90 Caliber Net while her attack is on cooldown, this ongoing cooldown will be refunded partially so that her next attack on them can begin earlier. Swapping the target to an enemy trapped by Yordle Snap Trap or 90 Caliber Net also reduces her ongoing attack cooldown. PENDING FOR TEST: : The exact attack cooldown refund appears to be 50% of the attack cooldown at current attack speed, but at a minimum amount it lets Caitlyn start the attack against the trapped target within 0. 5 seconds of her previous attack windup completing. The bonus range from Rapid Firecannon will not have any effect during trap and net extended Headshot attacks. Only the ordinary 100% attack damage portion of the attack can critically strike. The bonus from Headshot is added after the critical strike is rolled. The full damage of Headshot applies life steal . Headshot is a single instance of damage, thus does not trigger Amumu's Tantrum's or Warden's Mail passives twice. The basic attack triggering Headshot can critically strike , but Headshot's damage remains unchanged if it does. Since Caitlyn's Art and Sustainability Update, Ability-granted Headshots are the same as the original Headshot override attack, though what lets them cast at high range is still relatively special. They trigger on-attack effects (including stacking Headshot ). PENDING FOR TEST: Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury , is special cased to search targets with the increased range as well. Because Headshot stacks are generated on-attack , Runaan's Hurricane bolts will not generate stacks towards Headshot . The empowered attack will not trigger against wards . Stacks will still be generated towards Headshot when attacking them.

Other abilities can be cast while dashing if they are input after the cast time. 90 Caliber Net's missile will fail to fire if Caitlyn is suppressed during the cast time.

The target becomes untargetable . Caitlyn or her target dies . Ace in the Hole reveals the target and Caitlyn through a buff that lasts for up to 4 seconds. The buff is applied to the target from the start of the cast time. The buff ends prematurely when the channel is canceled or the bullet hits an enemy. The target is revealed for 1 second if the buff is ended prematurely. It is not removed if the cast time is cancelled or the bullet missile is destroyed. (bug) The ability also goes on a 5-second cooldown if Caitlyn enters resurrection during the cast time. The cast time does not end prematurely but the channel will be immediately canceled the moment the cast time completes. If the target dies after the bullet has been fired, the shot will continue towards their corpse and may still hit other enemy champions. The bullet has a sight radius of 1500 attached to it. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). This excludes losing sight of the target.

Original View in 3D 880 04.01.2011 Renowned as its finest peacekeeper, Caitlyn is also Piltover’s best shot at ridding the city of its elusive criminal elements. She is often paired with Vi, acting as a cool counterpoint to her partner’s more impetuous nature.

Katarina's name has the same roots. Caitlyn's accent is a Received Pronunciation spoken in south of England . Caitlyn's rifle can be seen in the trailer for the game's Mac version. A Yordle Snap Trap can be seen shortly after. Caitlyn has the longest base basic attack range in the game at 650 units . Her dance and taunts resemble several rifle moves in modern Color guard corps. Headshots actually fires at the target's head; this is most noticeable with tall targets like Baron Nashor or Enemy Turrets . When Caitlyn and Vi are on the same team, they are granted the cosmetic buff On the Case . This buff gives them extra gold when they score a takedown together. If there is a Jinx on the enemy team, Caitlyn gets the cosmetic debuff Catch me if you can! This debuff displays a counter of 'criminals apprehended' (kills/assists scored against Jinx).
