After casting an ability , this bonus is tripled to 45% − 120% (based on level) for 3 seconds. Innate: Diana's basic attacks generate a stack of Moonsilver Blade for 3. 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks and stacking up to 2 times. At 2 stacks, Diana empowers her next basic attack to consume the stacks on-hit to additionally cleave nearby enemies, dealing them 20 − 220 (based on level) (+ 50% AP) magic damage .

Magic Damage: 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+ 70% AP) Lunar Rush interacts with Moonlight . Crescent Strike will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Even if the target spell shields the bolt, they may still be damaged by the explosion. Moonlight is not applied to the protected target if blocked. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. If the ability is cast at max range and she is moved backwards while casting, the bolt will travel to the target location with increased distance. (bug) Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Diana_QVideo.ogv Edit Pale Cascade Pale Cascade COST: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 mana COOLDOWN : 15 / 13. 5 / 12 / 10. 5 / 9 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 200 Active: Diana grants herself a shield for up to 5 seconds and creates three spheres that orbit her for the same duration, detonating upon contact with an enemy to deal magic damage to nearby enemies. Shield Strength: 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 (+ 30% AP) (+ 9% bonus health) Magic Damage per Orb: 18 / 30 / 42 / 54 / 66 (+ 18% AP) Total Magic Damage: 54 / 90 / 126 / 162 / 198 (+ 54% AP) If all three spheres detonate, Pale Cascade's shield is reapplied, stacking with its original shield and refreshing the duration. Maximum Shield Strength: 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 / 210 (+ 60% AP) (+ 18% bonus health) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked On the second application of Pale Cascade's shield, Shield Power will apply to both the new shield amount and the shield amount remaining from the first shield, which has already benefited from shield power . Because of this, shield power effectively applies to the second shield twice, but with reduced efficiency, for up to an increase of 50% of shield power (maximum benefit if no damage was mitigated by the first shield). With 10% shield power , the second shield's total amount will be increased by up to an additional 5%, for a total of 15. 5 % bonus shield. The formula for the total amount of shield Diana will receive from both shield applications is: Total Shield = (((Shield Amount × (1 + Shield Power)) - Damage Blocked by Shield) + Shield Amount) × (1 + Shield Power) Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base shield changed to 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160. Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Diana_WVideo.ogv Edit Lunar Rush Lunar Rush COST: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 mana COOLDOWN: 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 825 Active: Diana dashes to the target enemy's location, and upon completion, she deals them magic damage and consumes Moonlight from all enemies. If the target is within 400 range, Diana will dash through their location. Magic Damage: 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 / 130 (+ 60% AP) If Moonlight is consumed from the target, Lunar Rush's current cooldown is reduced to 0. 5 seconds. Diana can cast any of her abilities during the dash. Hide Details Tips & Tricks Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Interrupted Diana will attempt to basic attack the target. This will not grant a stack of Conqueror , Electrocute , or Phase Rush . Lunar Rush's cooldown will also be reset if the target dies during the dash while being affected by Moonlight . Lunar Rush consumes Moonlight upon ending the dash (even if interrupted ). Lunar Rush will still deal damage even if the target is untargetable by the end of the dash. If Lunar Rush is blocked by spell shield the Moonlight debuff is still consumed but Lunar Rush's cooldown is not reset. Tips & Tricks Since Moonlight is consumed upon ending the dash, a Crescent Strike cast mid-dash can still cause a reset. Lunar Rush only consumes present Moonlight from the enemies. Because of this, it is possible for Lunar Rush to be reset multiple times during the same Crescent Strike cast, until it finishes its trajectory.

Crowd control immunity and displacement immunity still count as being "pulled in" by the ability. Clones count as champions for increasing this ability's damage. Moonfall's additional damage is not capped at 4 champions. The beam of moonlight does not crash down if champions hit blocked the initial effect with spell shield . Enemy champions protected by spell shield do not count towards the damage increase. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. A lunar phase of the moon will appear above Diana while she is casting Moonfall , each phase is based on the number of enemy champions pulled: New Moon: 1 Enemy Champion Pulled Waning Crescent: 2 Enemy Champions Pulled Third Quarter: 3 Enemy Champions Pulled Waning Gibbous: 4 Enemy Champions Pulled Full Moon: 5 Enemy Champions Pulled Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 300 / 450 / 600.

Original View in 3D 880 07.08.2012 Bearing her crescent moonblade, Diana fights as a warrior of the Lunari—a faith all but quashed in the lands around Mount Targon. Clad in shimmering armor the color of winter snow at night, she is a living embodiment of the silver moon’s power. Imbued with the essence of an Aspect from beyond Targon’s towering summit, Diana is no longer wholly human, and struggles to understand her power and purpose in this world. Nicole Oliver Kienan 'Knockwurst' Lafferty Loot eligible Dark Valkyrie View in 3D 975 07.08.2012 Occasionally, a valkyrie will be seduced by the comforts of mortal life, and be cast out from the halls of Valhalla. Understandably, this makes them pretty upset with Valhalla's whole management style.

Even her kin regard her methods as extreme, and she has been rightly elevated for it. Nicole Oliver Yan Li Infernal Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Blood Moon View in 3D 1350 09.02.2017 A child chosen by the Blood Moon itself, Diana's mind has been opened to the lost ways of the cult—unknown to its leaders, and even the slavering demons beyond. Hers is a truth no one can know, and a fated metamorphosis beyond men and the gods. Nicole Oliver Pan Chengwei Blood Moon Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Dark Waters View in 3D 1350 31.05.2018 Diana was once an extremist within the Order of the Mother Serpent, but now spends her days murdering her employer's enemies by the light of the moon.

Nicole Oliver Xiao Guang Sun, West Studio Dragon World Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Dragonslayer Diana Chromas Citrine Emerald Obsidian Pearl Ruby Sapphire Battle Queen View in 3D 1350 10.12.2020 Exiled for heresy, Diana has assented to return to her queendom to save her people—nothing else. She intends to use the Coronation to prove her worth and force Eos' elders to admit the truth of her beliefs: that the Crest answers to the will of the nation, not its leaders. Nicole Oliver Francis Tneh, West Studio Battle Queens Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Prestige Battle Queen View in 3D Special 10.12.2020 After revealing the truth at her nomination ceremony, Diana will let nothing stand in her way.

But the only way to fight an Aspect's power is with another Aspect—and so Diana takes up her blade as a member of the Sentinels, knowing that Viego would destroy everything the moonlight touches.
