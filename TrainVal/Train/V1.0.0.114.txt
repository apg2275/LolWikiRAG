Runes Fixed a bug where Greater Mark of Might's tooltip was incorrect. Hotfix A hotfix for this patch went live on the 5th of April, with the aim of adjusting Lee Sin , who was considered underpowered by the majority of the community. The hotfix contains the following changes [1] : Flurry Energy restoration per hit increased to 15 from 10. Sonic Wave / Resonating Strike Attack damage scaling increased to 100% from 80%. Tempest Attack damage scaling increased to 100% from 60%. Dragon's Rage Attack damage scaling increased to 200% from 150%. Other changes to Lee Sin that couldn't be done via hotfix, including tooltip changes for the abilities above, were released in V1.0.0.115 . Undocumented changes Champions Pantheon General Walking animation has been updated. Grand Skyfall Fixed a bug where AoE circle wasn't showing for some users. Nasus Spirit Fire Particle has been updated. Patch preview For this patch, we’re mainly focusing on bug fixes, as well as some more buffs to several champions . The reason we went for this focus was to prepare for the upcoming patch, in which we’re preparing some interesting solutions to damage-vs-defense, counters to tank-stacked teams, and other larger balance changes. We added an extra maximum Yordle Snap Trap to Caitlyn , which will improve her team utility presence, along with an attack speed boost to give her a little more ability to scale into late-game damage. Garen ’s movement speed was increased to 320, and gave a massive early game increase to the damage reduction on Courage . This ability needs to be more reliable in the laning phase to allow Garen to close and be effective. Doubling the rank 1 value should be a big help in this regard. Galio ’s ultimate has had it range increased by 50, to give it some additional value in more spread out fights. We plan to continue adjusting Galio. Finally, we’ve changed turrets to protect better against unattended minion waves, but less against coordinated pushes. We wanted to avoid lengthening game times, but at the same time want to make it so leaving minion waves unattended isn’t quite so punishing. This change aims to accomplish that.
