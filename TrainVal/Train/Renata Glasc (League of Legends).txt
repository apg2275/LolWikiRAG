If the enemy was unmarked, the attack also deals bonus magic damage equal to 1% − 2% (based on level) (+ 2% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health . Allied champions' damaging attacks and abilities against a marked target will consume the mark to deal additional bonus magic damage equal to 1% − 2% (based on level) (+ 2% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health . Leverage's damage is capped at 150 against monsters . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield See Notes Spell shield will not block the mark's application. PENDING FOR TEST: : Interaction with mark consumption Edit Handshake Handshake COST: 80 Mana COOLDOWN : 16 CAST TIME: 0. 25 RANGE: 900 / 275 WIDTH: 140 TETHER RADIUS: 1200 SPEED: 1450 Active: Renata fires a hook in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first enemy hit and roots them for 1 second, during which they are revealed . If the root was applied, Renata forms a tether between her and the target for the same duration, causing Renata to become unable to declare attacks and have her movement speed reduced by 30% . Magic Damage: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 80% AP) Handshake can be recast while the tether is active. Recast: Renata breaks the tether to knock the target in the target direction, though not through terrain, dealing the same damage to enemies they pass through. If the thrown target is a champion , all secondary targets hit are stunned for 0. 5 seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Applies spell damage to the primary target and area damage to secondary targets. Handshake's interaction between its tether and root: If the root is not applied, neither is the tether. The tether's duration lasts the same as the root duration, even if it is modified by tenacity . If the root is removed, the tether is as well, but not vice versa. Spell shield will block the hook but not the recast's effects as the primary target. As a secondary target, the recast's effects will be blocked. Renata may still move while the hook is in flight. Her facing direction is locked towards the target direction of the hook. While the target is hooked, Renata's facing direction is considered to be in their direction and not in the one she is moving. The movement speed reduction stacks additively with other movement speed bonuses. It is a negative bonus, not a slow , and is thus not reduced by slow resist . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Edit Bailout Bailout COST: 80 Mana COOLDOWN : 28 / 27 / 26 / 25 / 24 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 800 EFFECT RADIUS: 1300 Active: Renata infuses herself or the target allied champion with a chemtech formula for 5 seconds, granting the target bonus attack speed in addition to bonus movement speed while they are facing nearby visible enemy champions and minions, both increasing in effectiveness by 100% over the duration. Bailout's duration resets whenever the target scores a takedown against an enemy champion within 6 seconds of damaging them. Bonus Attack Speed: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30% (+ 1% per 100 AP) Maximum Bonus Attack Speed: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60% (+ 2% per 100 AP) Bonus Movement Speed: 10 / 12. 5 / 15 / 17. 5 / 20% (+ 1% per 100 AP) Maximum Bonus Movement Speed: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% (+ 2% per 100 AP) If the target takes fatal damage while Bailout is active, they are restored to 100% of their maximum health but suffer a true damage burn equal to 10% of their maximum health every 0. 264 seconds until they die from reaching 0 health, during which Bailout's duration resets every 0. 25 seconds. This effect may occur only once per application of Bailout while the target already has the buff and is not burning. During this time, if they score a takedown against an enemy champion within 6 seconds of damaging them, the burn is stopped prematurely and their current health is set to 20% of their maximum health . Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage taken in excess of the fatal damage taken does not apply to the target's health after it was restored. The self-damage taken is considered raw damage and is calculated based on the target's maximum health at the time of taking lethal damage. Bailout's bonuses will not reset in effectiveness if its duration is refreshed. Bailout takes priority over all resurrection and zombie state effects. Bailout will stop refreshing its duration while the target is burning after 250 seconds have elapsed. Bailout cannot be used on clones nor zombie state units. If the target takes fatal damage during Bailout , upon destroying a turret while being targeted by it, they will receive their own shutdown instead of being executed. (bug) The target will only receive the bonus gold and will gain a kill on the leaderboard. Edit Loyalty Program Loyalty Program COST: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 800 EFFECT RADIUS: 325 / 225 WIDTH: 220 SPEED: 1450 Active: Renata sends out chemtech rockets from either side of her that instantly strike targets around her. After 0. 429 seconds they converge and travel to the target location as a single missile, striking targets along its path and exploding upon reaching the target location. Renata and allies struck are granted a shield for 3 seconds and enemies struck are dealt magic damage and slowed by 30% for 2 seconds. Magic Damage: 65 / 95 / 125 / 155 / 185 (+ 55% AP) Shield Strength: 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 / 110 (+ 50% AP) Loyalty Program will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile See Notes Blocked Spell shield will block either the rockets while they are in-flight or their explosion. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Edit Hostile Takeover Hostile Takeover COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 150 / 130 / 110 CAST TIME: 0. 75 RANGE: 2000 EFFECT RADIUS: 750 / 1000 WIDTH: 500 ANGLE: 14° SPEED: 650 - 1000 Active: Renata launches a cloud of potent chemicals that travels in the target direction, granting sight of its surroundings. Enemy champions and minions hit become berserk for a duration. Berserk Duration: 1. 25 / 1. 75 / 2. 25 Berserked units gain 100% bonus attack speed and 25% increased size . Within their targeting radius, they prioritize attacking the closest unit by the following categories in descending order: Their allied champions Allied non-champions Allied wards Enemy units (including monsters ) Link ▶️ "You work for me now!" Hide Details Tips & Tricks Info Targeting input Direction Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked See Types of Crowd Control#Berserk for specific details on Berserk. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Typically, any enemies killed that directly result from Berserk are credited to Renata Glasc .

Debra Wilson Jeremy 'Jermu' Anninos Loot eligible Admiral Glasc View in 3D 1350 17.02.2022 Ambitious, cunning, cutthroat – these qualities served Admiral Glasc well during the Galactic Civil War.

As the Enterprise Family's founder, the bond between members doesn't come from any sense of familial warmth but from honest calculation.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] All of Renata's abilities are references to real-world financial terms. Leveraged finance is the use of an above-normal amount of debt, as opposed to equity or cash, to finance the purchase of investment assets. Handshake is the famous accordance social act between two negotiators. Bailout is when a business, an individual, or a government provides money and/or resources (also known as a capital injection) to a failing company. Loyalty Program is a marketing strategy designed to encourage customers to continue to shop at or use the services of a business associated with the program. Hostile Takeover occurs when an acquiring company attempts to take over a target company against the wishes of the target company's management.
