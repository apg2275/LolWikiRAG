The cinematic he stars in, A Twist of Fate , is directly named after this phrase. Many of Twisted Fate's abilities were named after real-life gambling or card-related terms. Loaded Dice are tampered dice that have a higher probability of having a certain side face up. Wild Cards references a wild card , which is a card that can represent any value in various card games. Pick a Card references the commonly used phrase that magicians say to their participants for card tricks. Stacked Deck references card decks that are unfairly stacked in order to give someone an advantage. Gate references the eponymous card game . Twisted Fate was one of the first six champions designed (the others being Annie , Lee Sin Singed , Sion , and Sivir ). Twisted Fate's dance references Gangnam Style by Psy . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Twisted Fate is the third champion to feature vocals while dancing (the others being Draven and Rengar ). Twisted Fate's eyes glow cyan in-game (only Cutpurse has his pupils visible) but they do not in A Twist of Fate . The icon for Loaded Dice is reused for the Teamfight Tactics item Loaded Dice . The Blue Card is also used to depict Gate .
