Immolate and Desolate are auto-targeted effects. Immolate deals 12. 5 (+ 2. 1875 % bonus health) magic damage per tick against minions . The aura increases if the user increases in size , but is not impacted by their base size. The aura cannot get reduced below the base radius by negative size modifiers. Because the aura effect must reach an enemy's center to damage them, some melee champions will not apply the effect at their maximum attack range against champions or monsters with a large enough collision radius (for example the Dragon or Rift Herald ).
