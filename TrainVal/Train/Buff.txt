Not to be confused with making a game feature more powerful via a patch Vayne using Final Hour . A buff is any status effect given to a champion or a minion that gives them a beneficial boost to their performance. The opposite is called a debuff . Buffs can benefit almost any attribute of a character, such as health , mana , attack damage , and ability power , but may provide more than mere statistical changes in some cases. Most buffs are temporary, but some may be permanent (such as Tristana's Draw a Bead permanently granting a range increase for her attacks and abilities). Most, but not all, are lost upon death . A buff given to Champion B by Champion A, such as Lulu's Help, Pix! , will apply Champion B's magic penetration, damage modifiers, etc... Some buffs can stack up to a predetermined number of times, but most buffs will not stack with themselves. This means that repeated applications of the buff to the same target will not grant any increased effect and will only cause the buff duration to reset. One exception is Milio's Warm Hugs , as its effects can stack up to 2 times. Certain abilities that have a unique cooldown before they can be used on the same enemy twice such as Yasuo's Sweeping Blade are not considered to be buffs applied to an enemy. There are several sources for buffs in League of Legends; specifically, abilities , epic monsters , field -specific buffs, items , speed shrines and summoner spells .
