At 3 stacks, Master Yi's next basic attack on-attack is empowered to consume the stacks to strike twice, the second strike dealing 50% AD physical damage . The second strike applies on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectiveness and is affected by critical strike modifiers. If Master Yi's primary target is killed before the second strike, he automatically attacks another enemy within 300 range. The second strike can critically strike structures . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Basic damage Physical Drawn Counters Parries Blocked Since Double Strike resets the counter on-attack and the second strike applies on-hit effects, the second strike is able to add a stack for the next Double Strike activation. If Double Strike's target becomes untargetable shortly after the triggering attack, it will still occur and deal its effects as usual. The second strike will trigger but not consume Double Strike stacks if the primary attack is dodged . PENDING FOR TEST: : Blind Edit Alpha Strike Alpha Strike COST: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Mana COOLDOWN : 20 / 19. 5 / 19 / 18. 5 / 18 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 600 EFFECT RADIUS: 600 Active: Master Yi vanishes and becomes unable to act . After 0. 231 seconds , he marks the target enemy and then proceeds to mark the nearest visible un-marked enemy within 600 units, recurring every 0. 231 seconds 「 up to 3 times. 」 「 for a total of 4 marks. 」 If there are no other un-marked targets before then, Master Yi can mark the same enemies again. During Alpha Strike , Master Yi can select a direction from the primary target. Upon finishing marking, Master Yi reappears 75 units in the targeted direction, or in front of the target otherwise, and then becomes able to act again 「 after 0. 165 seconds . 」 「 1. 087 seconds total after the start of the cast with 4 bounces. 」 If the primary target dies or is too far away during the delay, Master Yi will reappear at the initial cast location instead. Master Yi then detonates the marks, dealing physical damage and applying on-hit effects at 75% effectiveness. Marks after the first on the same target instantly deal 25% damage and apply on-hit effects at 18. 75 % effectiveness. Alpha Strike deals bonus physical damage to monsters per hit. Physical Damage: 30 / 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 (+ 50% AD) Reduced Damage per hit: 7. 5 / 15 / 22. 5 / 30 / 37. 5 (+ 12. 5 % AD) Maximum Single-Target Damage: 52. 5 / 105 / 157. 5 / 210 / 262. 5 (+ 87. 5 % AD) Monster Bonus Damage: 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 / 175 Monster Total Damage: 105 / 160 / 215 / 270 / 325 (+ 50% AD) Reduced Monster Damage per hit: 26. 25 / 40 / 53. 75 / 67. 5 / 81. 25 (+ 12. 5 % AD) Max Monster Single-Target Damage: 183. 75 / 280 / 376. 25 / 472. 5 / 568. 75 (+ 87. 5 % AD) Alpha Strike's primary and lesser damage can critically strike for bonus physical damage equal to (17. 5 % + 7% ) AD and (4. 375 % + 1. 75 % ) AD respectively. Basic attacks on-hit reduce Alpha Strike's current cooldown by 1 second . Wuju Style and Highlander can be cast during Alpha Strike. Each time Alpha Strike hits a target, the durations of Wuju Style and Highlander are refreshed by their current duration. Alpha Strike does not trigger its cooldown reduction nor grant a stack of Double Strike when applying on-hit effects. Link ▶️ "Many foes, one strike!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Grounded See Notes See Notes Disabled Alpha Strike's primary damage applies after Master Yi reappears. Alpha Strike's cooldown reduction applies on structures . When Master Yi bounces from a unit it will grant vision in a 600 radius around it for up-to 0. 627 seconds after Alpha Strike ends, including across terrain, though not into brushes . It will always grant vision around the primary target, even if he doesn't bounce off it. Alpha Strike's damage is calculated at the moment that each mark is placed. Because of this, it is possible to inflict differing amounts of damage if Master Yi's AD changes between marks. Master Yi will follow all his primary target's movements. Alpha Strike can only follow up-to 2000 units; If the target teleports a very long distance, it will not be followed. If the primary target becomes untargetable and there are no other nearby valid targets, Alpha Strike will end prematurely and will not deal the damage occurring after Master Yi's reappearance. The choice of exit direction occurs through an indicator anchored to the target during the time that Master Yi is vanished. Selection commands (default: MB1/left click) and movement commands (default: MB2/right click) are both valid. Multiple commands can be issued, but only the final command before exiting will determine the direction. If the primary target is a champion, Master Yi will be automatically ordered to basic attack them after Alpha Strike ends. Master Yi will not be able to buffer other abilities. (bug) Spell shield will only block a single instance of damage. On-hit damage applied by Alpha Strike will be negated by dodge and block , but not while Master Yi is blinded . Alpha Strike's own damage will not be negated. If Master Yi dies during Alpha Strike and he is only focusing one target, the ability will only deal the reduced damage strikes and not the final tick of damage from reappearing. If he is striking multiple targets the damage will be dealt immediately when dying , and if he dies before the bounce from the last target, Alpha Strike will deal reduced damage only to all units he already bounced from. (bug) If Master Yi enters resurrection during Alpha Strike and he is only focusing one target, the ability will deal the reduced damage strikes as normal and the final tick of damage after being resurrected . If he is striking multiple targets, Alpha Strike will sometimes deal the reduced damage from repeated bounces and the main damage after being resurrected , and sometimes only the reduced damage, unrelated to the number of targets available.

He shared this dance with Katarina , whose dance references the other portions. Master Yi's title in the Chinese localization also dubs him as a "Sword Sage", a title given to most master swordmen in history such as Miyamoto Musashi. In the Chinese localization, it is instead named as "Wuji" (無極, lit. Extremeless/Apolar/Infinite). Wuji is also represented by an empty circle atop the Taijitu (太極圖 lit. Great Poles' Chart), which includes the well-known Yin and Yang . His Wuju Style ability in Chinese is also dubbed as "Wuji Jiandao" (無極劍道, lit. Extremeless Sword Path), "jiandao" is also the pinyin reading of Japanese kendou .
