Miss Fortune reveals herself for 4. 5 seconds if there is an enemy champion within the area. Targets cannot be damaged by more than one projectile per wave. The bullet streams that each fire 1 projectile per wave are spead by 6° between one another, aiming towards the angles +-3/9/15° from Miss Fortune's facing direction. Bullet time picks 6 locations on the ground 500 units from Miss Fortune (with the aforementioned angles) and fires a bullet stream towards each. If Miss Fortune is moved to a new location, these locations will update (since patch V13.3 ); the cone will fire towards her new facing direction. Bullet time fires the first wave at 0. 066 seconds , and the last at 2. 904 seconds . Times between waves are equally spread between these values. Miss Fortune may cancel the last ~0. 1 seconds of channel time at no loss of effect.
