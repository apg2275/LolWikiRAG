Strategy As Vampiric Scepter is a necessary component for almost all of the life steal items. Vampiric Scepter increases the sustain of any champion, but it is best used with champions that use basic attacks as their main method of offense as life steal only works with basic attacks. Champions that do not use basic attacks often will find the life steal to not be very effective. Vampiric Scepter is often used with Doran's Blade , allowing champions to stay in lanes for extended periods of time without needing to go back to base to heal. Doran's Blade is often the preferred item as it also adds health, but its drawbacks are not building into other items. Old icons 1st version 2nd version 3rd version Trivia
