The user preserves their current mana whenever they increase their maximum mana from consuming charges of Manaflow . Manaless champions cannot trigger Manaflow . Summoning pets also triggers Manaflow . Selling a Manaflow item removes the bonus mana gained from the effect but retains the stacks if these items are bought again, regardless of which item generated the stacks.
