Basic attacks against enemies with Frost are modified to deal 120% (+ (75% + 40% ) of critical strike chance) damage. Innate - Critical Slow: Ashe's critical strikes do not deal any additional damage, instead they double Frost's slow strength to 40% − 60% (based on level) , decaying over 1 second to its normal strength. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Sub-type Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Blocked Blocked Ashe's critical strikes are still considered critical strike damage that will be reduced by Randuin's Omen . Runaan's Hurricane's will not deal additional damage on critical strikes . Cheap Shot will trigger on a subsequent basic attack even when the target is no longer slowed. (bug) Video https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ashe_Passive_Video.webm Edit Ranger's Focus Ranger's Focus COST: 30 Mana + 4 Focus CAST TIME: none Passive: While Ranger's Focus is inactive, Ashe's basic attacks on-attack generate a stack of Focus for 4 seconds, which refreshes on subsequent attacks and stacks up to 4 times. Stacks expire by one every 1 second. Active: For 6 seconds, Ashe gains bonus attack speed and empowers her basic attacks to fire a flurry of five arrows. Bonus Attack Speed: 25 / 32. 5 / 40 / 47. 5 / 55% Each arrow deals modified physical damage that benefits from Frost Shot and life steal . Flurries apply on-hit effects only once. Physical Damage Per Arrow: 21 / 22 / 23 / 24 / 25% AD Total Damage Per Flurry: 105 / 110 / 115 / 120 / 125% AD Ranger's Focus resets Ashe's basic attack timer. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Not Blocked Blocked Blocked The first attack from Ranger's Focus has 6 arrows, thus dealing 20% more total damage than expected. Ranger's Focus first bolt deals basic damage with the subsequent 4 bolts dealing a non-reactive damage type (e.g. default damage or proc damage ).  The entire effect is classified as a basic attack on a script -level, but is considered an ability for other effects (i.e Sap Magic ), which is likely due to a mistaken script-level tag. Although Ranger's Focus has no actual cooldown, 4 stacks of focus are needed before Ranger's Focus can be reactivated. The time before being able to reactivate Ranger's Focus is 6. 08 − 1. 6 (based on attack speed) seconds. Each arrow from a flurry applies Frost and the bonus damage from Frost Shot is calculated individually per arrow. Similarly, since a flurry is 5 instances of physical damage, Black Cleaver allows her to cleave the enemy target 5 times per flurry. Sources of flat damage reduction against any (physical) damage such as Amumu's Tantrum , Leona's Eclipse or Fizz's Nimble Fighter will apply the reduction to each arrow's damage, resulting in extremely reduced damaged compared to a normal attack. Each additional arrow from Runaan's Hurricane will also split into 5 arrows. The arrows are evenly distributed among secondary enemies but one enemy cannot be hit by more than 5 arrows. The flurry will trigger on-hit effects once to each enemy hit, but no more than 3 targets per attack. The flurry applies against structures . Stacks of Focus will not be granted when attacking structures.

Arrows: 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 Physical Damage: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 (+ 100% AD) Enemies can intercept multiple arrows but do not take damage from any beyond the first.

Between each missile spawn location is a distance of 12. 5 units, except for the two outermost ones at the last two ranks (which are 11. 5 units from the closest other one), and the two centermost missiles at ranks 2 and 4 (which have 20 units between them and 15 units to the next missile, respectively). This inconsistent behaviour of spawn locations means the angle between each missile can vary off of 4. 625 ° slighty. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Ashe periodically stocks a Hawkshot charge, up to a maximum of 2. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location Counters Spell shield Projectile Not Blocked See Notes Hawkshot's recharge timer seems to start at the beginning of the game, even prior to ranking the ability, but upon actually ranking the ability, it starts with one charge and the recharge timer starts from 0. Hawkshot will ping enemy champions it spots if allies didn't already have vision of them, and put a 'revealed' visual effect on them for 2. 75 seconds , but does not actually reveal the units in particular, and is removed if the champion leaves the area. Hawkshot will grant assist credit if a previously-unseen enemy champion is killed within 10 seconds of being revealed by the ability. Hawkshot will trigger upon colliding with Blade Whirl or Wind Wall or but not Unbreakable . Hawkshot will grant 0.33 points of vision score for each champion revealed.

Original View in 3D 260 21.02.2009 Iceborn warmother of the Avarosan tribe, Ashe commands the most populous horde in the north. Stoic, intelligent, and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader, she taps into the ancestral magics of her lineage to wield a bow of True Ice. With her people’s belief that she is the mythological hero Avarosa reincarnated, Ashe hopes to unify the Freljord once more by retaking their ancient, tribal lands.

A side by side comparison can be seen here. Ashe shares similarities with Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca from Final Fantasy XII . Their names are similar and both became queens, use ranged weapons (Ashelia uses hand bombs in Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings ) and were once hunted down to prevent them from leading their respective peoples. Ashe is the first (and so far the only) champion to possess two global-ranged abilities: Hawkshot and Enchanted Crystal Arrow . Timewinder and Chronobreak's ranges can be global, albeit situationally. Ashe was named for Marc 'Tryndamere' Merrill 's wife Ashley. As of December 9, 2017 Ashe has featured on the free champion rotation more than any other champion (76 times). In Summoner's Rift , Thornmail was once recommended as a situational item for Ashe , this was most likely a reference to the old Basic Tutorial where Ashe is pre-selected as the player's champion and Thornmail is the only purchasable item. In the now-removed official League of Legends forums , the icon of Focus was used to represent the "New Player Forum" section.
