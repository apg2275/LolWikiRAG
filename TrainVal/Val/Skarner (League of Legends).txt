Capturing a Crystal Spire grants sight of its radius for 1. 5 seconds and locks it out from capture for 15 seconds. Crystal Spires grant 30 split among its captors, or 15 for a single captor. Skarner gains Crystal Charge while within range of a Crystal Spire controlled by his team, for 1. 25 seconds after triggering Crystal Venom , and for 1. 75 seconds after stinging an enemy champion with Impale . Crystal Charge: Skarner gains 70 − 120 (based on level) bonus movement speed and 43% − 160% (based on level) bonus attack speed and restores 1% maximum mana every 0. 5 seconds. Crystal Spires near buff monsters start the game already captured by the side's respective team. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Passive Crystal Charge's duration refreshes if it was gained by an ability. Map-Specific Differences Howling Abyss differences edit Number of Crystal Spires spawned on the battlefield changed to five: One in each brush (with the central one being neutral) One in each team's base (below each inhibitor) ARAM Crystal Spires appear at: One nearby each inner turret . One at the center of the map. Edit Crystal Slash Crystal Slash COST: 10 Mana COOLDOWN: 3. 5 / 3. 25 / 3 / 2. 75 / 2. 5 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 350 Active: Skarner slashes around himself, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies. If at least one enemy is hit, he becomes charged for 5 seconds, empowering subsequent casts of Crystal Slash to deal bonus magic damage . Physical Damage: 1 / 1. 5 / 2 / 2. 5 / 3% of target's maximum health (+ 20% AD) Bonus Magic Damage: 1 / 1. 5 / 2 / 2. 5 / 3% of target's maximum health (+ 20% AD) (+ 30% AP) Each instance of damage is capped at 200 against epic monsters . Basic attacks reduce Crystal Slash's current cooldown by 0. 25 seconds, increased to 1 second against champions . Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical damage / Magic damage Counters Spell shield See Notes Spell shield will block the damage but will not prevent Skarner from triggering the bonus effect. Basic attacks against structures will not trigger the cooldown reduction. As already noted, each damage instance is capped on its own, meaning that the maximum possible damage against an epic monster with one cast is 400. In order to hit the cap, the target needs to have at least 20000 / 13334 / 10000 / 8000 / 6667 health (without considering the ratios). Map-Specific Differences Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit No longer reduces its cooldown on-hit. * Arena differences edit Damage health ratio changed to 1 / 1. 375 / 1. 75 / 2. 125 / 2. 5 % of target's maximum health . AP ratio changed to 40% AP . Edit Crystalline Exoskeleton Crystalline Exoskeleton COST: 60 Mana COOLDOWN : 13 / 12. 5 / 12 / 11. 5 / 11 CAST TIME: none Active: Skarner grants himself a shield for up to 6 seconds, and while it holds, he gains bonus movement speed that doubles over the first 3 seconds.

Edit Fracture Fracture COST: 55 Mana COOLDOWN: 14 / 13. 5 / 13 / 12. 5 / 12 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1000 WIDTH: 140 SPEED: 1500 Passive: Every time Skarner triggers Crystal Venom or stings an enemy with Impale , Fracture's current cooldown is reduced by the corresponding base duration of the disable. Active: Skarner launches a blast of crystalline energy in the target direction that deals magic damage to enemies hit, slows them for 2. 5 seconds, and marks them with Crystal Venom for 5 seconds. Magic Damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 20% AP) Slow: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% Crystal Venom: Skarner's next basic attack against a marked target is empowered to consume the mark to deal bonus physical damage and stun them for 1. 25 seconds. Bonus Physical Damage: 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Magic damage / Physical damage Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile Blocked See Notes Blocked Fracture is disabled during Impale . This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Fracture's projectile deals area damage , while the Crystal Venom on-hit effect deals proc damage . Crystal Venom triggers even if the attack is blocked ( stun applies), but not if it's dodged or he is Blind . The damage of the entire attack is negated in both cases. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Stun duration changed to 1 second. Edit Impale Impale COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 100 / 80 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 350 Active: Skarner roots the target enemy champion over the cast time and attempts to impale them with his stinger. Upon impaling the target, he deals 60% AD physical damage plus magic damage and suppresses them for 1. 75 seconds, during which they are revealed and Skarner can drag them with himself. Afterwards, the target takes the same damage again. Magic Damage: 20 / 60 / 100 (+ 50% AP) Total Mixed Damage: 40 / 120 / 200 (+ 120% AD) (+ 100% AP) Impale's drag ignores displacement immunity . Skarner is unable to basic attack, cast Fracture , or use Flash during Impale. Link ▶️ "Feel my sting!" Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Physical / Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Blocked The target will not take Impale's secondary damage if the suppression is removed before the duration ends. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). The range cancel distance is 800 units. Spell shield will not block the root . Impale is special cased to end prematurely if the target is affected by Devour , both for an ally and enemy Tahm Kench or if Skarner is teleported by Realm Warp . Impale will not end prematurely if Skarner enters resurrection . Skarner cannot use gates during Impale . While Impale is active, and for the purposes of direction-conditioned abilities, (e.g. Petrifying Gaze , Mocking Shout ) Skarner is considered to be facing in the direction he is moving and not the one his model is facing. Impale applies a small displacement to the target every 0. 25 seconds whenever they are not close to Skarner . These displacements do not apply airborne and are not flagged as displacements , meaning that targets who are not immune to the suppression are also never immune to the displacement either. As a consequence, displacement immunity fails to ignore this movement.

For all associated collection items, see Skarner (Collection) . Original View in 3D 880 09.08.2011 Skarner is an immense crystalline scorpion from a hidden valley in Shurima. Part of the ancient Brackern race, Skarner and his kin are known for their great wisdom and deep connection to the land, as their souls are fused with powerful life crystals which hold the living thoughts and memories of their ancestors. In an age long past, the Brackern entered hibernation to avoid untold magical destruction, but recent, threatening events have roused Skarner. As the only Brackern awake, he strives to protect his kind from those who seek to harm them.

More than one caravan has been lost to the creatures, the bones of their passengers picked clean.

Perhaps the brain inside it wishes to inflict as much pain as it experiences—or maybe it just likes to kill things.

His kind are the radiant antithesis of the ancient, squirming things that lurk in the deep darkness of space, and beyond it.
