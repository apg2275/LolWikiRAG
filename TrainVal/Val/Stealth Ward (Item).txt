Recipe Cost Sell ID Special No Sell 2044 Availability SR 5v5 Menu Starter Items>Laning Tools>Consumable Tools>Vision & Trinkets Keywords green Stealth Ward (Item) was a consumable item in League of Legends . It was exclusive to Classic Summoner's Rift 5v5 . Notes Ward before V3.12 If you place a ward after you already have three out, the first one you placed is removed and a new ward is placed in the position indicated. Wards placed into walls will jump to the nearest placeable location, as shown in this video . Teleporting to the ward will reveal it for the duration of the spell, although it remains invulnerable. Stealth wards can only be purchased on the Summoner's Rift map. Wards have a cast range of 600. The ward has 3 HP, and every attack will only damage it by 1. There is also no way to regenerate a ward's health . Wards grant gold to the killer as well as to users granting stealth-detecting vision of the ward, e.g. Sweeping Lens . The Wards placed by Sightstones are identical. Strategy Intelligent usage of wards goes a long way, namely in key brush locations, like intersections, in front of Dragon and Baron Nashor . This is useful for map awareness of potential ganks, champion movements, and/or attempts to kill an Epic Monster. The lone shrub in front of both Epic Monsters is an excellent place to both reveal the river and keep tabs over their presence. Wards that are placed on a Noxious Trap will cause the mushroom to explode, a damage free method of removing them. Certain characters with attack-timer refreshing abilities can clear wards in the moments after they are placed. Fiora can autoattack then use Bladework . Shyvana can use Twin Bite along with an autoattack. Lucian can autoattack, then use Ardent Blaze or Relentless Pursuit and his passive Lightslinger , on the next auto will strike twice. Renekton can autoattack followed by Ruthless Predator , or use a Fury-enhanced cast of Ruthless Predator by itself. Leona can attack, activate and use Shield of Daybreak , and immediately attack again. However the third attack is not automatic and must be ordered by the player. Jayce can use Hyper Charge while in Cannon form to gain maximum attack speed for 3 attacks without the need to reset the attack timer. Master Yi can utilize his passive Double Strike and an extra basic attack after, providing that the passive is triggered before or after the singular basic attack. Lee Sin's Safeguard , Jax's Leap Strike can be used to dash to allied wards. This can be used to move over walls, chase enemies, or escape.
