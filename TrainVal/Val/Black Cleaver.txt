Fervor can grant the bonus movement speed from clones . Carve stacks will transfer to clones . Carve by itself is not blocked by spell shield . Carve triggers on most cases of physical damage being dealt, including pets and effects that apply multiple instances of the damage type. On-hit effects , which are different from on-hit abilities, do not apply an additional stack of Carve . The only exception is Runaan's Hurricane . Note that the item exclusions will sometimes not apply the Carve stack. However, if they are triggered by Guinsoo's Rageblade , then they will always apply it. Runaan's Hurricane will also apply an additional stack of Carve to the primary target because it deals them 0 physical damage on-hit. The first instance of physical damage dealt does not benefit from Carve's armor reduction. The damage dealt is calculated first, and then the armor reduction debuff is applied afterwards. This means that every instance of physical damage dealt benefits only from the armor reduction of the previous stacks. Based on the effect, multiple instances of physical damage applied at the same will only apply one stack. (bug) Zed's Razor Shurikens thrown by him and his Shadows and Illaoi's Tentacle attacks, only apply one stack. Graves' Basic Attack , Xayah's Bladecaller and Kled's Pocket Pistol apply a stack for each instance of damage. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Ability haste changed to 25.
