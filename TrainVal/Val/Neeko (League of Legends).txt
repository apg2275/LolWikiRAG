She can choose a new champion to switch her disguise or select herself to deactivate her disguise, placing Inherent Glamour on a 0. 5 -second cooldown. Taking damage from a champion or turret puts Inherent Glamour on a 2-second cooldown. Standing by the nearest visible allied or neutral non-champion non-structure unit while not disguised will gather its Sho'Ma over 2 seconds, adding its disguise to the collection. Activating this disguise places Inherent Glamour on a 1-second cooldown. Neeko can collect only one Sho'Ma , but can discard or consume it. She can store Sho'Ma from the following units: Non-epic monsters Minions Traps Wards Pets Jungle plants While disguised, Neeko can use basic attacks while keeping her form. Her disguise breaks if her form takes lethal damage or if she becomes immobilized , deals damage to a structure with a non-champion form, or uses a damaging ability , summoner spell , or item active . Inherent Glamour's disguise is not deactivated from Pop Blossom until after 0. 5 seconds of its cast. Neeko cannot activate Inherent Glamour while she is unable to cast abilities. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Neeko can store up the Sho'Ma of multiple units at a time. Inherent Glamour's cooldown only prevents Neeko from activating disguises; she can still store and remove Sho'Ma while the passive is on cooldown. If Neeko attempts to activate a disguise while near and for the trap, ward, or jungle plant she stored Sho'Ma for, she will leap to that unit's exact position over 1 second and then become disguised. If she does so for a monster and is near its respective jungle camp, she will leap to that monster's usual position in the camp. She will fail to activate the disguise after the leap if she is affected by the same conditions that would break a disguise. Neeko will copy aesthetics as well as superficial mechanical statistics . She will fake a number of readings: Health bar (original's current amount becomes her apparent maximum) Secondary resource - e.g. mana , energy or none at all (original's current amount becomes her apparent maximum) Stats Buffs and debuffs with their respective icons and VFX/SFX (there are exceptions) Neeko sees the buffs that are actually applied to her, while enemies see the disguised champion's buffs. Kill feed icon A number of attributes she actually adopts are: Base movement speed The melee or ranged classification of the champion Base attack speed and attack ratio The projectile or non-projectile quality of their attack Attack range (adopt the new form attack range ) Size (including size modifiers and base champion size) Default transformation toggle (non-innate) Voice lines Character interactions (jokes, taunts, dances, laughs, toggle effects), as well as their Recall animation Neeko can copy Samira's taunt animation but she will not actually throw the coin via the Taunt ability. Inherent Glamour's disguise is broken by the following spell casts: Casting Blooming Burst or Tangle-Barbs . Casting Pop Blossom will not break the disguise immediately, but after a delay. Using Exhaust , Ignite , or Smite . Activating Hextech Rocketbelt , Stridebreaker ), Redemption or Minion Dematerializer . The scoreboard's question mark of Neeko (which indicates an enemy is not currently visible to your team) will disappear, if the disguised Neeko is visible. Therefore, it can be used to determine, whether a unit is Neeko or not.
