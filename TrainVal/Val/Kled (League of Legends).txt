While Mounted , all damage dealt to the duo is suffered by Skaarl , who has 400 − 1550 (based on level) (+ 100% bonus health) base health . Effects based on percentage health consider Kled and Skaarl's combined maximum health . Being reduced to 0 health causes Skaarl to flee, forcing Kled to be Dismounted , with all damage in excess of Skaarl's health being ignored. Upon dismounting, Kled dashes in the direction of the allied Nexus , though not through terrain, cleanses himself of all crowd control and becomes unable to act , untargetable , and immune to crowd control for 0. 5 seconds, during which he also reduces all incoming damage received by 100%. While Kled is Dismounted , his base health and base movement speed are reduced, his base attack range is increased, Bear Trap on a Rope is replaced with Pocket Pistol , and Jousting and Chaaaaaaaarge!!! become unusable. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Counters Grounded Knockdown Not Disabled Not Interrupted It is possible for the Nexus Obelisk to not be able to bring Kled down from Skaarl for a few seconds, even if Skaarl has no health. Kled's health is rounded up while Skaarl's health is rounded down. Health regeneration only regenerates Kled's or Skaarl's health, not both. The only crowd control status which Kled's dismount does not dispel is Realm of Death . Video Edit Bear Trap on a Rope Bear Trap on a Rope COOLDOWN: 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TETHER RADIUS: 800 − 650 (based on time active) Active: Kled throws a bear trap in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit, increased by 50% against minions and small monsters .

Physical Damage: 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 (+ 65% bonus AD) Minion and Small Monster Damage: 45 / 82. 5 / 120 / 157. 5 / 195 (+ 90% bonus AD) The tether's radius shrinks over its duration, and if it is not broken before then, Kled pulls the target 100 units toward him, deals physical damage , inflicts Grievous Wounds for 5 seconds, and slows them for 1. 5 seconds. Physical Damage: 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 (+ 130% bonus AD) Total Physical Damage: 90 / 165 / 240 / 315 / 390 (+ 195% bonus AD) Slow: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% Bear Trap on a Rope can be cast while Jousting .

Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked The bonus damage applies life steal . Attacking a plant will not activate the effect. This is intentional to prevent Kled from "wasting" the cooldown. Video Edit Jousting Jousting COOLDOWN : 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 550 / 700 Active: Skaarl dashes in the target direction, though not through terrain, dealing physical damage to enemies he passes through and pulling minions and small monsters hit towards them. Physical Damage: 35 / 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 (+ 65% bonus AD) Upon hitting an enemy champion or large monster , Skaarl dashes a fixed 200 -units through them, marking them for 3 seconds, during which they are revealed . After the dash ends, the duo gain 50% bonus movement speed for 1 second. Jousting can be recast after 0. 5 seconds of the first dash ending while the target is marked. Recast: Skaarl consumes the mark to dash through the marked target, applying the same effects as the first cast. Total Physical Damage: 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270 (+ 130% bonus AD) The mark will remain even if the target dies, and ends prematurely if the duo are too far away or Kled dismounts .

Jousting can be recast even while the target is untargetable . Video Edit Chaaaaaaaarge!!! Chaaaaaaaarge!!! COOLDOWN : 140 / 125 / 110 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 3500 / 4000 / 4500 SPEED: 950 Active: Kled & Skaarl charge toward the target location, automatically navigating terrain along the way, during which they're ghosted and immune to crowd control . If the charge does not complete within 15 seconds, it will end prematurely. The charge is interrupted instantly if Kled dismounts during it. While charging, the duo gain bonus movement speed and a shield for every 0. 25 seconds of traveling, up to 950 total movement speed over 3 seconds and 10% − 100% (based on time traveling) of the maximum shield amount over 2. 25 seconds respectively.

Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Not Interrupted Kled and Skaarl will track the target if they change locations. They will dash to the target's previous location if the target is too far away or moves beyond 2500 units. During the charge the duo gain: (950 − ( current movement speed )) ÷ 12 × (time ÷ 0. 25 ) bonus movement speed Kled and Skaarl are immune to crowd control during the charge as well while dashing to the target. The bonus movement speed is not affected by movement speed caps . The charge will not give any movement speed to Kled if he has more than 1440 movement speed. The trail will not give Kled and his allies any movement speed if they have more than 840 movement speed. Movement speed is granted merely by facing the direction of the draft. Enemies gain partial vision of Kled when he charges nearby. Kled will re-path if his current pathing is blocked by a newly created terrain (either player created or by the Mountainous Rift ). The charge will continue towards the target location even if Kled's location changes drastically. The following table refers for interactions while Kled is charging: Attacking Disabled Abilities Disabled Movement Allowed, but cannot input movement commands.

Kled has 410 − 1838 (based on level) base health , which is not improved by sources of bonus health , as well as reduced base movement speed and increased attack range . Effects based on percentage health consider Kled and Skaarl's combined maximum health , meaning that a Dismounted Kled is always considered to be low health. Kled gains 100 − 185 (based on level) bonus movement speed while moving towards visible enemy champions within 1000 units, but his basic attacks against them are reduced to 80% AD physical damage . Additionally, he gains the ability to restore Skaarl's Courage to mount again. Innate - Courage: Kled gains 15 Courage when basic attacking an enemy champion, 20 Courage whenever he scores a takedown against an enemy champion within 3 seconds of damaging them, 4 Courage for minion kills, and 5 Courage when basic attacking a structure or epic monster . At 100 Courage , Skaarl returns with 45 / 55 / 65 / 75% (based on level) of Skaarl's maximum health and Kled becomes Mounted after 0. 7 seconds. Mounting up resets the cooldowns of Bear Trap on a Rope and Jousting . While at the allied fountain , 25 Courage is generated every 0. 25 seconds. If reuniting outside of base, Skaarl gets Frayed Nerves , which prevents him from gaining Courage for 30 seconds. The current status of Kled's own health is preserved between subsequent dismounts. While Mounted , healing and health regeneration will first replenish Skaarl's health and will only apply to Kled's health while Skaarl is at full health. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Clones are counted as champions for all of this passive's effects, other than the takedown one. After attacking a champion, the bonus movement speed buff is granted for 1. 5 seconds regardless of whether he is moving towards a visible enemy or not. It is possible to get the Courage from base but have Kled and Skaarl reunite out of base. If Kled achieves 100 Courage while resurrecting or enters it while in the process of remounting, the remount will be deferred to after he revives.

Original View in 3D 975 09.08.2016 A warrior as fearless as he is ornery, the yordle Kled embodies the furious bravado of Noxus. He is an icon beloved by the empire’s soldiers, distrusted by its officers, and loathed by the nobility. Many claim Kled has fought in every campaign the legions have waged, has 'acquired' every military title, and has never once backed down from a fight. Though the truth of the matter is often questionable, one part of his legend is undeniable: Charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, Skaarl, Kled fights to protect what’s his… and to take whatever he can get. Spike Spencer Evan 'Somnicidal' Monteiro Loot eligible Sir View in 3D 975 09.08.2016 Sir Prince Chevalier Archduke Lord Double-Earl Kled (or Sir Kled, for short) is a half-mad knight from the aptly named Kingdom of Kled, which contains exactly two subjects: Kled, and his cowardly avian mount, Skarl. Together, the pair ravage the countryside to 'reclaim' Kled's 'land', which apparently is… all land, everywhere.

General Kled, one half of the pair that currently leads the regime, is truly the incarnation of their historic brutality… and little more. If it weren't for Xin Zhao, Kled would bet everything on a final, bloody, battle.

The get-up won Kled and Skaarl a blue ribbon at Beagle's Bridge, so if ain't broke, don't fix it. Here's hoping that the more "refined" judges at this year's Summoner Sweetie's Pet Show agree.

Kled and Skaarl are the first champion with two health bars, combining to form the highest in-game base health, with Kled's being the lowest. Kled is also the first champion and one of the two champions in the game whose health cannot be improved except through growth per level, the second being Pyke . Kled, while dismounted , has the lowest base movement speed of all champions at 285. Mr. Kled's Wild Ride is most likely a reference to the Disneyland attraction Mr. Toad's Wild Ride from the animated film The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad , originally adapted from the children's novel The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame. Kled and Skaarl , as Mr. Toad and Cyril the Horse respectively. J. Thaddeus Toad And Cyril Proudbottom Mr. Kled's Wild Ride is a probable reference to " MR BONES WILD RIDE ", a custom roller coaster built in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 called  that took in game years to complete its course. Then, once a passenger finally got off the ride, it led back to the start of the ride, creating an never-ending cycle of riding the attraction. One of the most famous quotes that a ton of riders thought was "I want to get off 'MR BONES WILD RIDE'". Kled is the first champion to swear (albeit censored) in-game. Kled's dismounted dance references the Moonwalk , a famous dance move . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. The song used in the short cinematic The Reunion is Edvard Grieg's , Peer Gynt - Morning Mood .
