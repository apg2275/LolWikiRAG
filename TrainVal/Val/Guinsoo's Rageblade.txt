Similar items Blade of the Ruined King Terminus Nashor's Tooth Wit's End Kraken Slayer Runaan's Hurricane Notes Wrath deals proc damage , and thus will not trigger spell effects . Seething Strike is not blocked by spell shield . Wrath's on-hit damage does not apply to structures . The bonus damage dealt by Wrath benefits from life steal . The Phantom Hit occurs a static delay after the basic attack was fired (independently of melee or ranged ), and will occur even if the attack was destroyed (i.e. Wind Wall ) or popped (i.e. untargetability ). The Phantom Hit from Seething Strike may generate stacks and trigger on abilities that applies on-attack effect. On-hit effects, such as those from single-use empowered attacks, will not benefit from Phantom Hit and will apply their effect only once. This is due to the on-hit effect itself being consumed by the initial strike and unavailable for the second. Phantom Hit does not interact with on-attack effects.

Old icons 1st version 2nd version Trivia Guinsoo's Rageblade is named after Steve 'Guinsoo' Feak , one of the main creative minds behind League of Legends and creator of Defense of the Ancients: Allstars . According to Feak, Guinsoo's Rageblade was created with Corki in mind. [1] It has a similar icon to the Defense of the Ancients: Allstars item Guinsoo's Scythe of Vyse, also named after Feak. Guinsoo's Rageblade was one of the last items released before the launch of League of Legends itself. There once existed a bug that enabled Sion to attain negative ability power and 2. 5 attack speed with Guinsoo's Rageblade alone. [2] The design is mostly similar to Kratos' blades (God of War franchise), both the Blades of Chaos and the Blades of Exile. Media Item VFX Hit VFX
