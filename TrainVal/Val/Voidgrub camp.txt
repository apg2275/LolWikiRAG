The shield decays over the duration. Notes [ ] Without slows, the Voidgrub has a movement speed of 350. When its patience runs out its movement speed is increased by 20%, to 419 .

Bug Fix: Individual Voidgrub aggro no longer conflicts with the camp's collective patience, causing them to be able to be leashed for further than intended and for long amounts of time.
