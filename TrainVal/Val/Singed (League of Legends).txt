Noxious Slipstream: For each stack, Singed gains 25% bonus movement speed , up to a maximum of 625% . This effect cannot occur on the same target more than once every few seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive No additional details. Edit Poison Trail Poison Trail COST: 13 Mana per second CAST TIME: none STATIC COOLDOWN: 1 EFFECT RADIUS: 180 Toggle: Singed continually creates a toxic cloud in his wake that lingers for 3. 25 seconds. The cloud inflicts poison to enemies within, and resets the duration every 0. 5 seconds while they remain. poison : The target takes magic damage every 0. 25 seconds over 2 seconds. Subsequent inflictions refresh the duration. Magic Damage per Tick: 5 / 7. 5 / 10 / 12. 5 / 15 (+ 10% AP) Total Magic Damage: 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 (+ 80% AP) Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Magic Toggle abilities do not count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. The clouds check for enemy targets in the area immediately upon being spawned. After a 0. 25 -0. 5 second delay, they check every 0. 25 seconds again until they fade. Targets already with the DoT can have the debuff refreshed only every 0. 5 seconds. Due to the inconsistent offset between the first and future ticks is it possible for a static target to miss out on one refresh of the debuff, equal to 3 ticks of damage. If Singed has moved less than 90 units since spawning the last poison cloud, it will spawn 35 units in front of him. They also only spawn every 1 second in this case. When Singed is moving faster than that, the poison clouds spawn more frequently and on top of himself. Map-Specific Differences One for All differences edit Poison Trail stacks with one another. Edit Mega Adhesive Mega Adhesive COST: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 17 / 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1000 EFFECT RADIUS: 265 Active: Singed spills a potent adhesive that lands at the target location after 0. 375 seconds, creating a field for 3 seconds that grounds enemies within and slows them. Slow: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Counters Spell shield Projectile Not Blocked Not Blocked The delay between the cast and the slow field being estabilished is inconsistent, due to a bug with tick rates. (bug) Karthus' Lay Waste and Defile's ticks beyond the first and Zac's Let's Bounce! have similar issues. The goo missile is VFX only, to convey which location Singed threw the adhesive at. It has a fixed travel time but is independent from when the zone is established. It is not destructible by effects such as Wind Wall . Mega Adhesive can be cleansed and resisted by crowd control immunity , providing immunity to the persistent area of effect if the target stays within the area. Leaving the area and entering back inside applies the ground regardless. Singed reveals himself to enemies briefly on-cast from fog of war if enemy targets are in the target area of Mega Adhesive . (bug) Edit Fling Fling COST: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Mana COOLDOWN: 10 / 9. 5 / 9 / 8. 5 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 125 Active: Singed flings the target enemy 550 units over himself, dealing magic damage , capped against minions and monsters . Magic Damage: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+ 6 / 6. 5 / 7 / 7. 5 / 8% of target's maximum health) (+ 60% AP) Maximum Non-Champion Damage: 350 / 360 / 370 / 380 / 390 (+ 60% AP) If the target lands on Mega Adhesive , they are rooted for a duration. Root Duration: 1 / 1. 25 / 1. 5 / 1. 75 / 2 Hide Details Tips & Tricks Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Spell damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Blocked Fling can throw enemies over walls (circumstances permitting). Slow-immune enemies will not be rooted when flung into Mega Adhesive . Fling is special cased to not fling Warwick while Singed is suppressed by Infinite Duress after the cast time. If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Tips & Tricks Singed may successfully issue a basic attack against the target of Fling while it is mid-air. Edit Insanity Potion Insanity Potion COST: 100 mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 110 / 100 CAST TIME: none Active: Singed empowers himself for 25 seconds with ability power , bonus armor , bonus magic resistance , bonus movement speed , bonus health regeneration , and bonus mana regeneration . Bonus Stats: 30 / 65 / 100 Regeneration per Second: 6 / 13 / 20 Total Regeneration: 150 / 325 / 500 During this time, Poison Trail additionally applies Grievous Wounds for 1 second, which refreshes every 0. 25 seconds while the poison persists.

Original View in 3D 260 17.04.2009 Singed is a Zaunite alchemist of unmatched intellect, who has devoted his life to pushing the boundaries of knowledge—with no price, even his own sanity, too high to pay. Is there a method to his madness? His concoctions rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake. Unknown voice actor Michal Ivan, Sixmorevodka Studio Loot eligible Riot Squad View in 3D 975 25.06.2010 A limited Riot Games skin given away at 2010 and 2011 events. Unknown voice actor Unknown artist Riot Loot inelgible New SFX/VFX Hextech View in 3D 520 15.08.2010 Zaun's early forays into Hextech were critical to the movement, but not all were met with success. The scientist known as Singed warped his mind and body as he looped noxious, magically-infused chemical byproducts into his veins, twisting himself into a monster. Unknown voice actor Unknown artist Hextech Loot eligible Legacy Surfer View in 3D 975 06.12.2010 Sure, the haircut is dated, and the off-brand sunscreen is a little dodgy, but Singed held out on the Tiki mug—and look what came roaring back into fashion! The man is a visionary. Unknown voice actor Unknown artist Pool Party Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Mad Scientist View in 3D 750 26.09.2011 Everyone thinks Singed is crazy.

Can anyone stop this vile malefactor before it's too late?! Unknown voice actor Unknown artist Silver Age Loot eligible New Animations/Recall Snow Day View in 3D 975 19.12.2013 Even deranged chemists need a day off, and Singed is no exception.

But the shadow soon found her, and as she so hungered for its power, Singed turned to the craven arts to speed her corruption. Unknown voice actor Pan Chengwei Omen of the Dark Loot eligible Beekeeper View in 3D 1350 11.10.2017 At first Singed wasn't certain he wanted to be a master beekeeper. But the moment he put on the protective suit, he knew it was destiny. Nowadays he can be found tending his hives, eating honey, or flipping any hapless wanderers that stop to gaze upon his work. Unknown voice actor Xu 'Crow God' Cheng Bees! Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Resistance View in 3D 1350 12.11.2020 Though many in the Resistance find Singed unsettling, few can deny his efficacy in pushing back the machine threat. For Singed, the only thing that matters is driving back Viktor's creations, whatever the means.

[2] [3] Coincidentally, Singed is an anagram for the word design, befitting his history of being one of the earliest designed champions. Singed was one of the champions chosen for the Noxian pool available during the Ionia vs. Noxus match . He was one of the selected champions. Singed's dance references Will Smith's "Jump on It" dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . He shared this dance with Kayle before the latter's rework, though hers includes the beginning of the dance. Even though Poison Trail's cloud appears to expand as it fades, the area affected by the poison does not actually increase. Singed is one of the few champions with a special interaction between his emotes and his ability set, as Fling automatically causes him to laugh. Although Singed holds his shield in his left hand in the default splash art, every other skin shows it in his right hand; Singed holds his shield in his right hand in all the in-game models. A bottle of Singed's poison can be seen leaking in the Mac Launch preview video. Singed's bald figure, red and green color motifs, and his large boots make him resemble Sigma from the Mega Man/Rockman X series.
