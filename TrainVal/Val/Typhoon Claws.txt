Notes “ Basic attacks grant Malice Charges upon hitting an enemy. After 3 stacks, your next 3 attacks will be at maximum attack speed but deal 50% reduced damage. — In-game tooltip The flurry of attacks behave like standard basic attacks. The in-game tooltip is poorly worded. While your character will display as having 2. 5 attack speed at 3 stacks, the effect is not a variation of Hyper Charge . The subsequent 3 attacks are performed as a flurry that takes one attack cycle to complete - making the effect more comparable to Ranger's Focus or Lightslinger , or giving an effective attack speed of 7. 5 . Unlike the latter abilities, the lesser attacks of Typhoon Claws behave entirely like standard basic attacks: they can critically strike (calculated individually per lesser attack); they will trigger all on-attack effects; and will apply on-hit effects. Although the damage modifier will affect AD-modified abilities, as with Sated Devourer . The 2. 5 attack speed is still important for the effect as "one attack cycle" at 2.5 attack speed takes 0. 4 seconds. The champion is considered to have 2. 5 attack speed, rather than 7. 5 , for the purposes of ability scalings. That said, as with Sword of the Divine , The Culling has been special-cased to not interact with the bonus attack speed from Phantom Hit. The Phantom Hit of Sated Devourer takes precedence over Typhoon Claws , effectively disabling Typhoon Claws' passive. Be wary when purchasing both. It is possible to change target mid-flurry and secondary targets will automatically be chosen if the primary target dies - though the time window for changing targets manually is short. Runaan's Hurricane side bolts don't contribute to the stacking of malice, as it is on-attack, not on-hit. The flurry however works with the side bolts too, unlike in Sated Devourer 's passive which only hits the main target.
