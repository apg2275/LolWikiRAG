Similar items Black Cleaver Bloodrazor Bloodthirster Guinsoo's Rageblade Hextech Gunblade Liandry's Torment Notes Item VFX Slow VFX The active is not considered a projectile . Life steal applies to the bonus damage even if it's dealt through other items/abilities, such as Guinsoo's Rageblade , Runaan's Hurricane and Double Up . It also benefits from Heal Power . The passive damage is not factored into critical strikes , as it is an on-hit effect. Spirit Visage increases the heal from the bonus damage twice, for 69% (1. 3 × 1. 3 ), instead of 30%. This only occurs if the heal comes from life steal. The movement speed buff stacks additively with other percentage movement speed buffs. Although Hextech Gunblade and Blade of the Ruined King both have a Bilgewater Cutlass in their recipe, their item actives are considered distinct from one another and will not put each other on cooldown. Strategy This item is often built as a form of "anti-tank" item used to counter health-stacking champions (or champions that scale well in health) such as Shen , Dr. Mundo , Volibear , Zac , and Taric . Blade of the Ruined King can be seen as a soft defensive item, as its active offers high utility. Depending on the situation, it can be used to lock down a target, evade skillshots , or most importantly, improve kiting. * Champions who are highly dependent on basic attacks ( Master Yi , Jax , Tristana , etc.) often build this item due to the attack speed, lifesteal, and the passive that helps boost their autoattacks. Champions with an attack speed steroid like Master Yi , Quinn , Xin Zhao , Nocturne or champions with on-hit effect abilities like Shyvana , Warwick , Renekton , Yasuo , Yone can synergize well with Blade of the Ruined King , making better use of the passive. Champions that autoattack and deal true damage also benefit from the passive on Blade of the Ruined King , as the best counter to true damage is to build health However, being able to constantly autoattack is still the foremost criteria. Prime examples are Olaf , Irelia or Master Yi . AD Casters can also consider picking this item up as a side item for extra damage and sustain vs HP targets, but only if they have abilities that directly synergize with auto attacks via applying on-hit effects (e.g. Renekton's Ruthless Predator , Jax's Empower and Wukong's Crushing Blow ). *** Even then, a majority of users of this item also often combine it with the likes of a Spellblade-proc'ing item such as Trinity Force . Thornmail and Frozen Heart are strong counters to Blade of the Ruined King , as both provide armor and an attack speed slow; in the former's case, it provides a Grievous Wounds effect that counters BotRK's lifesteal. The latter's case has more armor and also has its attack speed slow in the form of an aura. However, when combined with lethality or any other form of defense-stat bypass, the HP-based damage will punch through easily in most cases against a variety of targets. Trivia Blade of the Ruined King is named after The Ruined King , who transformed the Blessed Isles into the undead-dwelling Shadow Isles after his 'grief overcame his reason' and lead him to attempt and fail to resurrect his wife. With the start of the preseason of Season 3 Madred's Bloodrazor was removed and was replaced by Blade of the Ruined King . Pentakill's second volume, Pentakill II: Grasp of the Undying , named its tenth track after this item.
