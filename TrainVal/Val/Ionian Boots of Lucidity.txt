Strategy Ionian Boots of Lucidity are a favored choice on attack damage casters, who prefer the ability haste to Berserker's Greaves' attack speed and don't tend to get as much ability haste from their other items as mages ( who, for this reason, tend to buy Sorcerer's Shoes instead ). Many supports also pick up Ionian Boots of Lucidity , as their utility to their team tends to come in a large part from their abilities . Mages can also pick them instead of Sorcerer's Shoes , but they have to buy other magic penetration items such as Void Staff to compensate. When picking Ionian Boots of Lucidity , keep in mind that sometimes it may be better to buy other boots, such as Mercury's Treads or Plated Steelcaps , as the defensive stats may be sometimes more useful than the extra ability haste.
