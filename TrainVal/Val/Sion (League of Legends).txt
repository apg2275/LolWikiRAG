Sion's health regeneration and any healing (except life steal) he receives during this time is 0% effective . Sion can only move and use his basic attacks and item actives , and empowers himself with the following effects: 1. 75 attack speed minimum and maximum 100% life steal Deals bonus physical damage on-hit equal to 10% of the target's maximum health , capped at 75 against non-champions Ghosting One cast of Death Surge , which replaces all of his abilities Sion's damage to structures is reduced to 40% under the effects of Glory in Death . Edit Death Surge Death Surge COOLDOWN: 100 Active: Sion gains 67% bonus movement speed (bug) that decays over 2. 376 seconds. Once at least one ability has been learned, Death Surge can be cast using any ability key, even for the abilities that haven't been learned yet. Hide Glory in Death Details Death Surge Details Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Physical Counters Parries Blocked Notes Details Sion's death timer starts when he dies and not when Glory in Death ends. If Sion lives longer than what his death timer lasts for, he will not revive until Glory in Death has ended. When it ends, he instantly revives. This may result in some odd interactions and bugs at times. The effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby. The health loss is unaffected by Invulnerability . Glory in Death has a capped 60 seconds duration. If the player manages to survive for so long, Sion dies instantly, regardless of his current health. The healing modifier during Glory in Death reduces all incoming healing, it does not matter if they are sourced from Sion himself or an ally. This does not affect life steal. This healing modifier stacks additively with Spirit Visage and does not stack with heal and shield power. This means that purchasing Spirit Visage enables Sion to have regeneration and use healing effects at 25% effectiveness, and the life steal gained will be increased to 125% as expected. The fixed attack speed is achieved by lowering and increasing the maximum and minimum attack speed to 1.75 , respectively. This also means that it's unaffected by other attack speed modifiers for the duration, such as bonus attack speed or cripples . However, Hail of Blades , which allows for the normal attack speed cap ( 2.5 ) to be surpassed, will also break this limit. This means that while it is active, Sion may exceed his 1.75 cap, but cannot fall below it. This does not apply to Lethal Tempo . When Hail of Blades ends, the attack speed cap will revert to 2.5 and not to 1.75 , however Sion still can't fall below 1.75 . Some item passives do not persist through death and will be lost for the initial few seconds of Glory in Death . Phase Rush cooldown is reset upon entering Glory in Death . The bonus on-hit damage granted by Glory in Death is unaffected by life steal, but is applied against structrures that are not turrets. However, it can be applied against structures that are not turrets. (bug) The reduction of damage against structures includes Sion's attacks as well as on-hit effects that can be applied to structures, such as Demolish , Titanic Hydra and the magic damage based on AP conversion based on adaptive force . It even includes true damage from sources such as Elixir of Sorcery . (bug) Sion , during Glory in Death , will not lose health while being carried by Fate's Call . Glory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion , such as with Test of Spirit . Glory in Death's untargetability from the stasis does not destroy in-flight projectiles . Projectiles created while Sion is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies. Upon death, the current cooldowns of Sion's summoner spells are increased to 4 seconds. Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns. However, it is possible for another lock-out effect to unlock them when their duration ends (excluding crowd control with the exception of stasis ). After Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain unit collision despite being dead on the ground. Buffs from jungle monsters that Sion acquired during Glory in Death will not be lost when the duration ends. ( Crest of Cinders , Crest of Insight ) Interactions & Other By surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will have suffered 41. 8 k − 443. 7 k (based on level) in health costs. Sion can also heal from spell vamp , althought the stat is currently unobtainable and it would be also unusable during Glory in Death , since there would be no available abilities that would apply it. Even though its visuals are present, Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death . At the start of Glory in Death , Sion's mana drops to 0, but his mana regeneration will remain in effect. Zombie info Zombie states trigger upon taking lethal damage . Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering. All resurrection effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie. A champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect. Most buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state. Those that persist through death, such as Brand's Blaze , will remain. Undisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by Veigar's Event Horizon and Viktor's Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost. (bug) This does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state. (bug) Units within a zombie state cannot: Use Recall or Corrupting Potion / Refillable Potion . Activate resurrection effects. Take Dark Passage , Catapult , or gates . Pick up the Eye of the Herald . Be targeted by the following: Bailout Chronoshift Umbral Trespass . Be affected by the following: Curse of the Black Mist Fear Beyond Death's chain missile Test of Spirit's initial missile Lamb's Respite Realm of Death Fountain health restore Targeting input Auto Notes Death Surge will grant the bonus movement speed after a brief delay. The buff is intended to grant 75% decaying movement speed, but instead grants 67% movement speed decaying with -8% per stat update. Precisely this leaves him at 0% − 0% (based on time passed) bonus movement speed. Death Surge has a shared cooldown across each ability key, regardless of which key is used to activate it. Thus, activating Death Surge with any ability key will put the others on cooldown. Death Surge's cooldown resets upon death. Death Surge's cooldown is affected by ability haste and thus the ability is technically able to be used up to twice during a single instance of Glory in Death , but this isn't practical. Death Surge is not affected by Ultimate Hunter , even if cast from the ultimate ability slot. Despite showing the cooldown being reduced, Death Surge in the ultimate ability slot will be not reduced by Axiom Arc's Flux on takedown . (bug) Death Surge's cooldown is not reduced by Navori Quickblades' Deft Strike . Edit Decimating Smash Decimating Smash COST: 45 Mana COOLDOWN : 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 CAST TIME: none RANGE: 500 − 850 (based on channel time) Active: Sion charges for up to 2 seconds to increase Decimating Smash's range over an area, knock up duration, stun duration, and damage every 0. 25 seconds, which has up to a maximum bonus for the base damage and up to a 200% bonus for the scaling damage. Maximum Base Damage Increase: 125 / 158. 33 / 175 / 185 / 191. 67 % Minimum Physical Damage: 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 (+ 45 / 52. 5 / 60 / 67. 5 / 75% AD) Maximum Physical Damage: 90 / 155 / 220 / 285 / 350 (+ 135 / 157. 5 / 180 / 202. 5 / 225% AD) Decimating Smash can be recast within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards. If the charge is interrupted , Decimating Smash is placed on a 2-second cooldown. Recast: Sion flails his axe in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies hit and slowing them by 50% for 0. 25 seconds. Decimating Smash deals 150% damage against monsters and 60% damage against minions . Minimum Monster Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 67. 5 / 78. 75 / 90 / 101. 25 / 112. 5 % AD) Maximum Monster Damage: 135 / 232. 5 / 330 / 427. 5 / 525 (+ 202. 5 / 236. 25 / 270 / 303. 75 / 337. 5 % AD) Minimum Minion Damage: 24 / 36 / 48 / 60 / 72 (+ 27 / 31. 5 / 36 / 40. 5 / 45% AD) Maximum Minion Damage: 54 / 93 / 132 / 171 / 210 (+ 81 / 94. 5 / 108 / 121. 5 / 135% AD) If Decimating Smash was charged for at least 1 second, Sion instead slams his axe down in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies hit, knocking them up for 0. 5 − 1 (based on channel time) seconds, and stunning them for 1. 25 − 2. 25 (based on channel time) seconds. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Projectile Disruption Blocked Not Blocked Interrupted For the target to be hit, their center needs to be inside the red or blue areas (based on charge time), and their edge must hit the yellow part of the cone. If their edge also hits the white part of the cone they will be excluded from being hit. Cone is at 16 degrees and starts 800 range behind Sion's center. White cone has a radius of 720, while yellow cone has a radius of 1550. Correction: The in-game description incorrectly states that the AD ratio is 45 / 57. 5 / 70 / 82. 5 / 95% AD , increased up to 135 / 172. 5 / 210 / 247. 5 / 285% AD based on channel time. Sion himself remains locked out of all actions for 0. 25 seconds when releasing Decimating Smash . Soul Furnace can be cast during this time, but Roar of the Slayer and Unstoppable Onslaught cannot and neither will they be buffered. Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun . Since the stun duration is longer than the airborne duration, and both start at the same time, Tenacity is still fully effective against Decimating Smash up to a cap. This virtual cap is 60%-55.5% Tenacity based on channel time beyond 1 second. Every value below this cap will lower the CC duration with no diminished returns. A flash of the axe and change in brightness of the indicator on the ground indicates when the 1 second time frame is reached. The damage of Decimating Smash is calculated when it is released. Gaining AD or upgrading the ability during its channel will update the damage of the coming hit. Even though the cooldown starts when the ability is released, it will not be changed by gaining or losing AH , or upgrading the ability, during the cast time. The indicator is visible to the enemy only if they see Sion himself. If the channel is released before 1 second, enemies may see a particle at the far end of the hitbox, if it itself isn't outside of their vision . If the channel is released after 1 second, the only remaining indication is the visual effects and audio that plays on any units the spell strikes (these play on-target), provided the enemy does have vision on those. Forced movement without a stun component (or the stun being cleansed previously) will not stop Sion from starting or continuing to channel. Its direction will not change with Sion's travel, however the location will update with him. The location of the indicator updates at the beginning of the ability, at 1 second and at release . The indicator of the ability is slightly shorter at its front than the hitbox of the ability is for Original Sion , Mecha Zero Sion and related skins and chromas, while on Worldbreaker Sion , the indicator is slightly thinner at the front than the hitbox is, instead.

Edit Soul Furnace Soul Furnace COST: 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 Mana COOLDOWN : 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 525 Passive: Sion gains 4 bonus health whenever he kills an enemy , increased to 15 for large enemies and takedowns against enemy champions . Active: Sion grants himself a shield that lasts for up to 6 seconds. Soul Furnace can be recast after 3 seconds while the shield holds, and does so automatically at the end of the duration. Shield Strength: 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160 (+ 40% AP) (+ 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12% maximum health) Recast: Sion consumes the shield to deal magic damage to nearby enemies, capped at 400 against minions and monsters . Magic Damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 40% AP) (+ 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 / 14% of target's maximum health) Both of Soul Furnace's casts can be activated during Sion's other abilities. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked A buff icon in the HUD will show the current shield strength, so that the player can better calculate the timing of the second cast. The initial shown value does not interact with shield strength modifiers . Whenever the shield takes damage, it updates to the proper current shield amount, however. The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Detonating the ability manually does not. Gaining or losing AP or health, or ranking up the skill while the shield is active will not change its shield value but it will change the damage of the shield's detonation. The cooldown of Soul Furnace begins once the shield is removed. Gaining or losing ability haste between the first cast and breaking of the shield will affect the resuming cooldown accordingly. Soul Furnace also automatically detonates if Sion is killed without the shield being destroyed, e.g. by dying to the Nexus Obelisk , even if Sion could not have detonated it manually yet. Soul Furnace's bonus health can be obtained by any of Sion's damage sources (basic attacks, abilities, summoner spells, item actives). This does not include last hits transferred to Sion artificially. If the gold efficiency of a Ruby Crystal is considered 100%, each last hit or takedown after Soul Furnace has been learned can be considered worth an extra 10. 6 or 40g . Sion must learn Soul Furnace before he can stack up its passive. Sion does not gain bonus health from units that enter resurrection on-death. Killing the following unit types grants Sion 15 bonus health : Champions ( kills and assists ) Large minions and large monsters (including both summoned and pit Rift Herald ) Large pets - Explicitly Tibbers , Daisy and The Maiden Killing the following unit types grants Sion 4 bonus health : Minions and small monsters Wards and other champion summoned units (e.g. Noxious Trap , Powder Keg , Dark Procession ) All pets , with the exceptions of those listed above and below Clones Killing the following unit types grants Sion no bonus health : Turrets (including Sun Disk ) and other structures Jungle plants (destroying which does not grant kill credit). Units destroyed by 'trampling' such as Zyra's seeds , Zac's goo or Rek'Sai's tunnels . Map-Specific Differences Nexus Blitz differences edit On-unit-kill bonus health doubled. (On- takedown bonus health unchanged). Arena differences edit Bonus health per champion takedown changed to 45. New Effect: Gains 1200 bonus health over the first 8 rounds.

Magic Damage: 65 / 100 / 135 / 170 / 205 (+ 55% AP) Slow: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% If the target is a minion or non-epic monster , they are also stunned for 0. 75 seconds and knocked back for up to 1350 units further, though not through terrain, applying Roar of the Slayer's effects to enemies they pass through as well as briefly granting sight of the area around their trajectory. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked See Notes Minions or monsters that are flung away are immune to minion damage and take their damage once they are stopped if they would die to Roar of the Slayer's damage, by either colliding with terrain, reaching the end of their trajectory, or having their displacement interrupted. Unlike the intial single-target projectile , a thrown minion or monster is not blocked by Wind Wall or Unbreakable . Gaining or losing AP , or upgrading the ability while its projectile is traveling will change its damage for every future hit. This applies to both the intial single-target projectile, as well as the minion-projectile. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Base damage changed to 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300. AP ratio changed to 80% AP . Armor reduction changed to 40%. Slow strength changed to 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 / 75%. Edit Unstoppable Onslaught Unstoppable Onslaught COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 140 / 100 / 60 CAST TIME: none Active: Sion becomes immune to crowd control and ghosted and, after a brief delay , charges forward in the direction of the cursor for up to 8 seconds, during which he is able to steer at a slow turn rate while automatically navigating his movement. Unstoppable Onslaught can be recast after 0. 4 seconds during the channel. The charge ramps up Sion's movement speed at the time of cast by 40 movement speed every 0. 1 seconds, up to 950 total movement speed . At the end of the charge's duration, Sion leaps forward 300 units, landing after 0. 55 seconds and slamming the ground beneath him. Sion will stop upon colliding with an enemy champion or terrain during the charge, ending Unstoppable Onslaught with a slam. Crashing into terrain stuns Sion for 0. 5 seconds. Enemies hit by Sion's charge are dealt physical damage . The base damage increases by 0% − 166. 67 % (based on channel time) and the scaling increases by 0% − 100% (based on channel time) . Minimum Physical Damage: 150 / 300 / 450 (+ 40% bonus AD) Maximum Physical Damage: 400 / 800 / 1200 (+ 80% bonus AD) Enemies, including turrets , hit by the slam are dealt the same damage and are slowed for 3 seconds. Enemies in a smaller radius are also pulled towards Sion over 0. 5 seconds and become stunned after a brief delay for 0. 25 − 1. 75 (based on channel time) seconds. Slow: 40 / 45 / 50% Recast: Sion stops charging, causing him to leap forward and slam the ground beneath him as if Unstoppable Onslaught had reached the end of its duration. Link ▶️ "Chaaaaaaaarge!" Link ▶️ Charge alert. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Direction / Auto Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Disruption Blocked Disabled Not Interrupted When Sion casts Unstoppable Onslaught a global warning can be heard. Unstoppable Onslaught does not apply the knock up nor stun to enemies from slamming on collision with terrain. Unstoppable Onslaught does not knock up non-champions hit by the charge. (bug) Unstoppable Onslaught can be activated twice or held down and released on both normal cast and quick cast. There is no other difference between normal cast and quick cast for this ability, either. The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade . The recast does not. An enemy can only be affected by Unstoppable Onslaught once every 1 second. After reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) Sion will transition from using his haste animation to his unique charging one. Reaching the threshold on Mecha Zero Sion changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the vehicle. The turning angle is not based on time and can easily be seen in practice when a Sion charges in-place due to bugs. Sion's movement speed gains during the charge are unaffected by movement speed caps . Effects that would increase or decrease his movement speed do not affect him as well. Nami's Surging Tides is the only known effect that can affect Sion's movement speed during the charge and that can place him above the normal MS value. However, without further multipliers, surpassing the 950 movement speed cap will require Nami to have over 2150 ability power . Sion does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle. Casting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the charge's direction. This is not usually possible with player-generated terrain. Unstoppable Onslaught cannot charge through but can leap over player-generated terrain . Sion loses the crowd control immunity after finishing the leap . Sion is not immune to an allied Bard's Tempered Fate if it hits Sion during the 0. 05 -second delay before he starts the channel, he will not resist the effect and will initiate the slam immediately while in stasis . (bug) Unstoppable Onslaught cannot strike the same non-champion twice in less than 1 second . Even though the cooldown of Unstoppable Onslaught starts at the end of the effect, gaining or losing ability haste , or upgrading the ability during the effect, will not change the resuming cooldown. Removing the airborne before 0. 5 seconds will not prevent the stun from being applied. Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the stun . Sion can occasionally cast Unstoppable Onslaught while rooted . In this case, he will stand in place until the root's debuff duration ends. During this time, the damage, stun duration and movement speed granted by the ability will still ramp up, and enemies that come into contact with him will be affected by the collision normally. (bug) A similar case allows him to cast it during crowd control that would disable it. However, the channel would be interrupted almost immediately, and he will initiate the leap as well. Fate's Call deferment of Unstoppable Onslaught will still allow Sion to leap forward at the end of the channel. Moving the cursor onto HUD elements (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not jeopardize the cast and steering of Unstoppable Onslaught . The targeting will act as if the ground was targeted below the display element. PENDING FOR TEST: The distance between Sion's center and the center of the ground slam scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of charge time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug. PENDING FOR TEST: The leap appears to always have the same speed regardless of Sion's , at roughly 750. The following table refers for interactions while Sion is channeling : Type Channel Attacking Disabled Abilities Soul Furnace and its recast are usable. Decimating Smash and Roar of the Slayer are disabled. This ability recasts to end channel. Movement Allowed, but cannot input movement commands.

Original View in 3D 585 21.02.2009 A war hero from a bygone era, Sion was revered in Noxus for choking the life out of a Demacian king with his bare hands—but, denied oblivion, he was resurrected to serve his empire even in death. His indiscriminate slaughter claimed all who stood in his way, regardless of allegiance, proving he no longer retained his former humanity. Even so, with crude armor bolted onto rotten flesh, Sion continues to charge into battle with reckless abandon, struggling to remember his true self between the swings of his mighty axe.
