The Red Brambleback is a neutral monster on Summoner's Rift . Killing the Red Brambleback grants the Crest of Cinders , a buff which grants health regeneration out of combat and causes basic attacks to apply a slow and a burn that deals true damage over time. When the map transforms into the Elemental Rift , the Red Brambleback becomes Draconic , gaining this form if alive and respawning in it each time. Killing it in this form leaves behind a buff wisp at the camp's location for 60 seconds. The wisp can be picked up by an allied champion moving near it, granting them the Crest of Cinders buff. If the killer did not have Smite , the wisp can only be picked up by a champion that does so. Once the Baron Nashor spawns at 20:00 , the Red Brambleback becomes permanently corrupted by the Void if it is not Draconic , transforming into a Voidborn with 30% increased health. Killing it in this form grants you and all your allied champions, if alive, the Crest of Cinders buff. Any remaining Draconic Red Bramblebacks that are slain respawn as Voidborn instead. Notes [ ] Without slows, the Red Brambleback has a movement speed of 275. When its patience runs out its movement speed is increased by 20%, to 330. Red Brambleback deals 5% of the target's current health bonus physical damage with its attacks. Trivia [ ] The Red Brambleback is the evolution of the Lizard Elder , a removed monster. The old icon for Crest of Cinders was recycled from Tabu's Wave of Loathing . Its in-game icon is reused for the Teamfight Tactics item Red Buff . Its animations were recycled for the Razorheart monster from Odyssey: Extraction , a rotating game mode . Patch History [ ] V14.2 Bug Fix: No longer respawns in its voidborn form prior to Baron Nashor's spawn after dying in its draconic form for the first time. V14.1 New Effect: Upon becoming Draconic , killing the Red Brambleback also drops a Crest of Cinders wisp at the location of the camp either for the player that has Smite equipped or, if the killer is the Smite user, at most one ally to pick up. The wisp lasts for 60 seconds. New Effect: After Baron Nashor spawns, all newly-spawned or live non- Draconic Red Brambleback monsters become permanently corrupted by the Void, transforming into voidborn with 30% increased health and granting the Crest of Cinders buff to the killer and all allies alive upon slaying it. The Red Brambleback loses its Draconic effects with the Corrupted monster's respawn. Removed: No longer always drops a Crest of Cinders wisp lasting for 60 seconds at the location of the camp when a player on the team has Primal Smite equipped.
