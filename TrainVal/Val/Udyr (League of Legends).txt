Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Auto Damage type Type Sub-type AOE DOT damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked The storm that Udyr surrounds himself with is independent from the unleashed storm. He can still cast Wingborne Storm to surround himself with a storm while an unleashed storm from an Awakened cast is active. Using the Awakened cast ends the storm around Udyr if it is active and summons a separate storm that is able to move on its own. The slow debuff has a duration equal to the storm's remaining duration and is removed immediately when the unit leaves the storm's area of effect. Units receive the debuff whenever they are in the storm, even after having it removed from leaving the area. If the target Udyr has most recently attacked is invalid and there are no nearby enemies then the storm will follow him instead. The storm can follow Udyr regardless of how far away he is from it. The storm will remain active even if Udyr dies. Any commands it was issued to follow a target will not be interrupted. The storm will follow its target even if they are not visible , but only for up to 1 second. If it does not gain vision of its target within that time, it changes its target. The storm is obstructed by terrain. If it encounters terrain, then it will automatically navigate its path towards the target. The empowered attacks will not trigger nor be consumed if they hit a structure or ward or are parried.

Original View in 3D 585 02.12.2009 The most powerful spirit walker alive, Udyr communes with all the spirits of the Freljord, whether by empathically understanding their needs, or by channeling and transforming their ethereal energy into his own primal fighting style. He seeks balance within, so that his mind does not get lost amidst others, but he also seeks balance without—for the Freljord's mystical landscape can only thrive with the growth that comes from conflict and struggle, and Udyr knows that sacrifices must be made to keep peaceful stagnance at bay. Sean Rohani Terence 'Terrylefruit' Cantal Loot eligible Black Belt View in 3D 520 18.07.2010 Students of the Hiraclaw Dojo know that the best way to tell people you're good at punching is to have a giant screen-printed fist on your clothes. That's a karate fact, according to sensei Udyr. Which is why their parents all buy them the special Hiraclaw gi (only $89.95). Sean Rohani Silvia Meiliani, Caravan Studio Day Job Loot eligible Primal View in 3D 975 06.12.2010 Cursed to roam the land as something between man and beast, Udyr no longer distinguishes between hunters and hunted. Once he gets close enough to strike, they are all his prey. Sean Rohani Rio Sabda, Caravan Studio Prehistoric Hunters Loot eligible Legacy Spirit Guard View in 3D 3250 16.07.2013 Udyr's time in Ionia, training at Hirana Monastery, taught him control and calmed the storm in his heart. Though the Freljord called him home, Udyr chose to stay and help Ionia regain spiritual harmony, as it had done for him. As he gets closer to this goal, he knows that his work to do the same for the whole of Runeterra has only just begun.

Through Udyr, a mystic who doubted the old tales, these dragon spirits have the chance to touch life once again. He believes that dragons are only as evil as those who command them and, in channeling the spirits and their flames, seeks to prove it to the slayers. Sean Rohani Unknown artist Dragon World Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Inkshadow View in 3D 1350 03.05.2023 Udyr has given up much as tattoo artist for the Inkshadow Warriors, sacrificing pieces of himself to multiple spirits and covering his body in their arcane contracts to enhance his natural second sight. He sees the souls of his canvases, knows the price they must pay, and connects them to the spirits who will give them the power to do what must be done.

However, in the Ultra Rapid Fire (2015) featured mode, there is no limit to a champion's level, so Udyr is able to have 6 levels for his abilities. He is one of the few characters without an ultimate along with Jayce . Udyr has 4 skills that can be leveled up to the maximum rank of 6. Udyr is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin . Udyr however has more different textures in one skin than any other champion, as he has a different one for each of his stances. Udyr's dance references the Drunken Master Kung Fu Style . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Udyr is one of two champions that went into the weekly champion rotation on the day of their release. The other one is Poppy . Udyr was one of the champions chosen for the Ionian pool available during the Ionia vs. Noxus match . He was one of the selected champions, and was voted the MVP. In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called "Urfdyr" , referencing Urf .
