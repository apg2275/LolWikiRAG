At the end of the duration, he explodes to deal 140 − 650 (based on level) true damage to nearby enemies. While under this state, Kog'Maw becomes invulnerable , untargetable , and immune to crowd control , but is also rendered unable to declare basic attacks , cast abilities , use summoner spells , and activate items . Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage True Counters Spell shield Blocked Icathian Surprise's untargetability does not destroy in-flight projectiles . After Icathian Surprise ends, the corpse of Kog'Maw will retain unit collision for the duration of his death animation. Icathian Surprise will still trigger if Kog'Maw is killed by the Nexus Obelisk . If Kog'Maw has the missile from a basic attack in-flight at the same time that he's moving while he dies, as long as the missile hits the target after Icathian Surprise has started, Kog'Maw will be able to use a basic attack once during Icathian Surprise . Kog'Maw's usable summoner spells will be placed on a 5 second cooldown upon becoming a zombie. During Icathian Surprise , Kog'Maw's attack range is reduced 「 to 0 」 「 by 500 」 , making him automatically path near enemies he is trying to target. Zombie states trigger upon taking lethal damage . Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering. All resurrection effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie. A champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect. Most buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state. Those that persist through death, such as Brand's Blaze , will remain. Undisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by Veigar's Event Horizon and Viktor's Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost. (bug) This does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state. (bug) Units within a zombie state cannot: Use Recall or Corrupting Potion / Refillable Potion .

Original View in 3D 880 24.06.2010 Belched forth from a rotting Void incursion deep in the wastelands of Icathia, Kog’Maw is an inquisitive yet putrid creature with a caustic, gaping mouth. This particular Void-spawn needs to gnaw and drool on anything within reach to truly understand it. Though not inherently evil, Kog’Maw’s beguiling naiveté is dangerous, as it often precedes a feeding frenzy—not for sustenance, but to satisfy its unending curiosity. Patrick Seitz Alex 'alexplank' Flores Loot eligible Caterpillar View in 3D 520 24.06.2010 Kog'Maw, ever lost in thought, sat upon his toadstool until he was famished. “Wonderland is full of such delights,” he mused, gulping down the toadstool entirely. “It would be a shame not to devour them all.” Patrick Seitz Unknown artist Storybook Loot eligible Legacy Sonoran View in 3D 520 24.06.2010 Long considered a pest by frontier settlers, Kog'Maw critters have been growing in number as more dangerous beasts are pushed to the brink of extinction. And they are very, very hungry. Patrick Seitz Unknown artist High Noon Loot eligible Legacy Monarch View in 3D 520 16.11.2010 Patrick Seitz Unknown artist Legacy Loot eligible New Animations/Recall Reindeer View in 3D 975 14.12.2010 It is rumored that Kog'Maw stole his glowing nose and deer antlers from a particularly adorable creature he devoured. Whether or not the theory is true, Kog'Maw is now the most famous reindeer of all. Patrick Seitz Unknown artist Snowdown Showdown Loot eligible Legacy Additional/unique quotes New SFX/VFX Lion Dance View in 3D 1350 01.02.2011 It is unclear if Kog'Maw even understands what Lunar Revel is, but someone seems to have painted him for it. That person has presumably been eaten and digested, but Kog'Maw does look very festive. Patrick Seitz Unknown artist Lunar Revel: Firecracker Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Deep Sea View in 3D 975 19.09.2011 “Perhaps my old mind was deceived by the fury of the storm. Yet as we sank, I glimpsed a field of lights beneath the waves, a thousand eyes of wicked alabaster… they were dark things tearing into the flesh of our crew as if all they ever knew was hunger.” Patrick Seitz Kienan 'Knockwurst' Lafferty Forgotten Depths Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Jurassic View in 3D 975 23.03.2012 Patrick Seitz Unknown artist Day Job Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Battlecast View in 3D 1350 25.11.2014 Mass-produced artillery units based on the now-extinct Kog'Maw organism, Viktor has invented an ingenious shell delivery system best appreciated from about a hundred miles away—the latest design's maximum range. Patrick Seitz Unknown artist Battlecast Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Pug'Maw View in 3D 975 29.03.2017 Pug'Maw is a nine month old purebred pug with a sweet disposition and possibly some sort of salivary problem. Great with children and pets. Highly food motivated. Has eaten three action figures and one doll, approach with extreme caution. Patrick Seitz Pan Chengwei Toy Box Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Pug'Maw Chromas Citrine Granite Meteorite Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Sandstone Speckled Hextech View in 3D Special 07.12.2017 A newer Hextech innovation, Kog'Maw constructs are available as pets for wealthy families, delighting Piltover's upper crust with their friendly demeanor and intricately complex design. Though living things, they are viewed among the well-to-do as little more than status symbols. Patrick Seitz Jennifer Wuestling Hextech Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Arcanist View in 3D 1350 09.07.2020 The diminutive familiar of a famed sorcerer, Kog'Maw was mistreated and neglected for years as his master pursued the arcane arts. Thanks to a chance meeting with Zoe, he was released from servitude to travel the land with her… ultimately enrolling in the same school Zoe technically attends.

Sightings are limited to abandoned ruins that only the bravest dare enter. But taming one is an even more challenging task. Only one Tamer has succeeded so far, their bond—and the Zap'Maw's lightning attacks—growing stronger each day.

Perpetually at odds with itself, its tail is addicted to feeding on the maelstrom's energy, while its head simply wants to devour everything in sight. Can anything within the Scrolls sate its growing hunger?

Renekton is also voiced by the same voice actor, while Lucian used to be voiced by the same voice actor. Kog'Maw's dance references Michigan J. Frog's dance from One Froggy Evening . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Despite Icathian Surprise causing him to blow up, Kog'Maw does have a 'normal' death animation which can only be seen when he's being revived by Chronoshift or Guardian Angel . Icathian Surprise is one of only three abilities that allow their casters to continue fighting after death , the others being Death Defied and Glory in Death . Kog'Maw is the only Void-related champion without 'Void' in his title. While idle Kog'Maw blinks one eye at a time and sometimes spins around in a manner resembling dogs chasing their own tail. Kog'Maw was the first champion to have a joke animation (the second being Miss Fortune ). Kog'Maw was first spotted in a screenshot from Malzahar's reveal. Maw is another word for mouth. Kog'Maw's abilities ironically make no use of his spoken-of and downright-self-stated insatiable hunger. Kog'Maw had his game assets reused for several featured game modes . He was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Scary Spitty Monster" in Invasion . His animations were reused for the Arcraptor and Skitterbeak monsters in Odyssey: Extraction . In the V1.0.0.115 April Fools' Day patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called "Seeing-Eye Kog" , referencing a seeing-eye dog, another term for Guide dog .
