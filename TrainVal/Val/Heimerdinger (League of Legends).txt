For all associated collection items, see Heimerdinger (Collection) . Original View in 3D 790 09.10.2009 A brilliant yet eccentric yordle scientist, Professor Cecil B. Heimerdinger is one of the most innovative and esteemed inventors Piltover has ever known. Relentless in his work to the point of neurotic obsession, he thrives on answering the universe’s most impenetrable questions. Though his theories often appear opaque and esoteric, Heimerdinger has crafted some of Piltover’s most miraculous—not to mention lethal—machinery, and constantly tinkers with his inventions to make them even more efficient. Dennis Collins Johnson Alex 'alexplank' Flores Loot eligible Alien Invader View in 3D 1820 13.07.2010 No one believed Heimerdinger when he tried to warn them about the invaders from outer space. They believed when he took off the wig. Dennis Collins Johnson Unknown artist Invaders Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Transforming Blast Zone View in 3D 520 24.06.2010 An eccentric scientist living in the New Bandle Republic, Heimerdinger has not yet told anyone he may have developed “a large pre-war bomb or two” for “one or more rogue governments”. He would prefer tinkering in a city that is not actively trying to kill him. Dennis Collins Johnson Yan Shu Road Warrior Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Transforming Piltover Customs View in 3D 975 22.11.2010 Heimerdinger moonlights as part owner of the city's most infamous customs dealer, where he generally adds an external engine and flame paint to vehicles of the rich and famous. Get him on a good day, though, and he'll build you a real monster—for a price. Dennis Collins Johnson Unknown artist Piltover Customs Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Transforming Snowmerdinger View in 3D 975 14.12.2011 Brought to life by the power of a magic hat, Snowmerdinger now pursues theoretical Snowdown sciences including snowball trajectory, cocoa cooling speeds, and automated turret construction. He engineered his own strain of carrot noses. Dennis Collins Johnson Unknown artist Snowdown Showdown Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX Transforming Hazmat View in 3D 975 13.07.2014 Sometimes, when he's alone at night, Heimerdinger wonders if the reason his head is so big is all that exposure to Zaun Grey. Then he gets tired, and rests his giant head against an equally giant pillow. Dennis Collins Johnson Suke 'hugehugesword' Su Day Job Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Transforming Dragon Trainer View in 3D 1820 11.10.2018 Dragon training, to the few who understand it, seems to be the sole domain of yordles. Heimerdinger has long believed that dragons and humankind can peacefully coexist, citing centuries of his own successful research. His current dragon hatchling, Pythagoras, holds no opinion on the subject.

Robert Oppenheimer and Erwin Schrödinger's last names. His given name Cecil comes from Caecilius , a Roman surname, from caecus "one-eyed > blind". [2] His dance references the Headspin , a breakdance move . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Heimerdinger's alternate/old walk is referred to as 'derpy'. Using any Emotes , or activating Heimerdinger's passive will make Heimerdinger alternate between his regular walk and his 'derpy' walk. While UPGRADE!!! is active, Heimerdinger gains a cosmetic buff that reads 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger'. If Heimerdinger scores a Pentakill, he will gain the cosmetic buff Eureka! This buff references Archimedes ' sudden revelation, only in Heimerdinger's case his own came after the mass murder of the enemy team. Heimerdinger is the sixth champion to have more than four abilities, the others being Elise , Gnar , Jayce , Karma , Lee Sin , and Nidalee . The icon for Hextech Affinity is reused for the Teamfight Tactics item Magnetic Remover . In the now-removed official League of Legends forums , the original icon of UPGRADE!!! was used to represent the "Help & Support" section.
