This effect cannot occur on the same target more than once every few seconds. Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Physical Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked Martial Cadence's damage is based on the current health of the target before any damage of the attack has been dealt. Martial Cadence's damage is dealt after the main attack damage. If the target dies to the main attack damage, the additional damage will not be dealt. The empowered attack will not trigger against structures . Edit Dragon Strike Dragon Strike COST: 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 Mana COOLDOWN: 10 / 9. 5 / 9 / 8. 5 / 8 CAST TIME: 0. 4 RANGE: 65 - 785 / 0 - 850 COLLISION RADIUS: 180 WIDTH: 136 / 300 Active: Jarvan IV extends his lance in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies hit and inflicting them with armor reduction for 3 seconds. Physical Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 140% bonus AD) Armor Reduction: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26% of target's armor If the lance connects with a deployed Demacian Standard , Jarvan IV dashes to its location, knocking up nearby enemies around him and along his path for 0. 75 seconds. Jarvan IV can cast any of his abilities during the dash. Hide Details Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Physical Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Not Disabled Interrupted The armor reduction is applied after the damage. The damage dealt does not benefit from it in this case. This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time. Dragon Strike will still pull Jarvan IV to Demacian Standard even if he is immobilized or grounded . Flash will interrupt the dash to a Demacian Standard but Jarvan IV will still knock up and damage enemies he comes in contact with at the new location. Casting Flash right before the dash begins will cause Jarvan IV to be pulled to the flag from the new position. Enemies already hit by Dragon Strike cannot be affected more than once. The knockup also slightly moves the target, landing 50-100 units in a random direction. Edit Golden Aegis Golden Aegis COST: 30 Mana COOLDOWN: 9 CAST TIME: none EFFECT RADIUS: 600 Active: Jarvan IV slows all nearby enemies for 2 seconds.

Shield Strength: 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 (+ 70% bonus AD) Hide Details Info Targeting input Auto Counters Spell shield Blocked No additional information. Edit Demacian Standard Demacian Standard COST: 55 Mana COOLDOWN: 12 / 11. 5 / 11 / 10. 5 / 10 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 860 EFFECT RADIUS: 200 / 1000 / 700 Passive: Jarvan IV gains bonus attack speed . Bonus Attack Speed: 20 / 22. 5 / 25 / 27. 5 / 30% Active: Jarvan IV throws a Demacian flag to the target location, dealing magic damage to enemies within the area. Magic Damage: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 80% AP) The flag then remains for 8 seconds, granting sight of its surroundings and providing an aura that grants bonus attack speed equal to Demacian Standard's passive to Jarvan IV and all nearby allied champions. Demacian Standard will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Hide Details Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked The attack speed granted from a deployed Demacian Standard stacks additively with Demacian Standard's passive permanent bonus attack speed to Jarvan , but the aura from multiple Demacian Standards does not stack. The flag has 13. 6 pathing radius and 65 gameplay radius . The gameplay radius matters to Dragon Strike . Demacian Standard can be targeted by allied abilities ( Teleport , Safeguard ). The target type is the same as a minion . Demacian Standard is untargetable to enemies. Edit Cataclysm Cataclysm COST: 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 120 / 105 / 90 CAST TIME: none TARGET RANGE: 650 EFFECT RADIUS: 350 / 1700 SPEED: Varies Impassable perimeter: 255 to 445 Active: Jarvan IV leaps with displacement immunity to the target enemy champion's location over 0. 35 seconds, dealing physical damage to all nearby enemies upon arrival. Physical Damage: 200 / 325 / 450 (+ 180% bonus AD) Upon impact, he creates a circle of impassable terrain that initially pulls units inside it. The terrain lasts for 3. 5 seconds and grants sight of the area. Cataclysm can be recast after 0. 75 seconds while the terrain is active. Recast: Jarvan IV destroys the terrain created by Cataclysm . Hide Details Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Area damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Grounded Knockdown Blocked Disabled Not Interrupted The initial cast and the manual recast count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. If the ability is not manually recasted, the secondary effect will trigger without being considered as an ability activation. Cataclysm will not deal damage, generate terrain, nor refund its cooldown if Jarvan IV is killed while leaping . The perimeter is made up of 24 units with 95 pathing radius , 65 gameplay radius and 1350 sight radius each. Only every other unit is rendered visible. Searing Charge will not destroy the whole ring but only the part that Ornn collides with. Champion skins [ ] This article section only contains champion skins.

A tab for Jarvan IV can be faintly seen at the top during Maokai's Art Spotlight . In-universe Demacian naming convention does not mirror real-life's European royalty and nobility's naming convention; as the current Jarvan should not have gotten the regnal number IV before his coronation. The terrain created by Cataclysm is made of 24 minions to make sure that no one can squeeze through the wall. [2] The old visual effects of Golden Aegis was once made up of little ghosts due being a recolored copy of Death's Caress .
