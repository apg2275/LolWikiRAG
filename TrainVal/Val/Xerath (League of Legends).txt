A circular indicator will be displayed at the target location to signify that the area will be blasted. A circle indicating the ability's maximum range forms on the map over 1 second (starting small and rapidly expanding to the maximum range over the delay) for the channel's duration. The maximum-range indicator is visible to both allies and enemies and is color coded for friendly (blue) or hostile (red). Rite of the Arcane uses a barrage system so that it can be recast multiple times within a given period at no additional cost. Xerath will turn to face toward the direction of the target location after using a recast. Xerath gains a wider field of view during Rite of the Arcane . Xerath can use Dark Passage while channeling.

Original View in 3D 880 05.10.2011 Xerath is an Ascended Magus of ancient Shurima, a being of arcane energy writhing in the broken shards of a magical sarcophagus. For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison. Driven insane with power, he now seeks to take what he believes is rightfully his and replace the upstart civilizations of the world with one fashioned in his image.

The resulting Xerath units are twisted, hellish monsters imprisoned in a cage of psychic energy, constantly discharging superheated plasma toward any opponent in range. Michael McConnohie Unknown artist Battlecast Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Scorched Earth View in 3D 1350 13.07.2012 A highly unstable creature born from roiling magma, Xerath possesses a keen intellect, awaiting the day he might ascend through the ranks of the Infernal war machine, and usurp the Ashen Lord himself. For now his ambitions remain secret, but… soon… soon… Michael McConnohie Unknown artist Infernal Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Guardian of the Sands View in 3D 1350 26.04.2015 Xerath, the liquid light—ancient guardian of the sands, we invoke thee to protect us from an evil of our own making. Let no man tread upon these hallowed grounds, lest you drown them in your purifying radiance.

Consuming all life and light as it passed , the Dark Star twisted the supergiant into a wrathful corruptant. Thus, Xerath was born—a dark being of malice and annihilation.

The more they are entranced by the forbidden, the more his power grows. But while Xerath believes their temptation will lead to his deliverance, he does not realize that the stronger he becomes, the more tightly his chains bind him.

After an explosion during one of his experiments, his body was permanently mutated. Now, fully consumed by the corrupted meeps, Xerath traverses the galaxy, seeking to spread his malice across the cosmos.

The icon for Xerath's ability, Arcanopulse is slightly similar to that of the Season 3 mastery Blast . Xerath's dance is a reference "industrial dancing", which is evident in the song Pong by Eisenfunk . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here . Xerath himself can be seen when he performs his taunt. As he disarms the parts of his sarcophagus, a person made of pure energy or electricity can be briefly seen. When he dies this "person" disappears, what remains on the ground are the shattered remains of his sarcophagus. It's likely that that form was his actual look before he got locked away. Some speculate that Xerath is ambidextrous as he uses both left and right hands for different attacks and abilities, unlike most champions who almost always use their dominant hand (usually their right one). Xerath is, along with Blitzcrank , Caitlyn , Lissandra , Rumble , Sion , Varus , Vi , and Ziggs , one of the few champions that can apply crowd control on themselves. Xerath's ethereal form imprisoned in a human-shapen sarcophagus also resembles Battle Realms ' Master Warlock , consisting of an ethereal warlock inside another warlock's skeletal remains. Xerath features as the Ancient Ascendant in the Ascension featured game mode .
