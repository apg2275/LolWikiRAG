Original View in 3D 790 06.08.2009 Cutting a burning swath through the darkest places of the world, Kassadin knows his days are numbered. A widely traveled Shuriman guide and adventurer, he had chosen to raise a family among the peaceful southern tribes—until the day his village was consumed by the Void. He vowed vengeance, combining a number of arcane artifacts and forbidden technologies for the struggle ahead. Finally, Kassadin set out for the wastelands of Icathia, ready to face any monstrous Void-construct in his search for their self-proclaimed prophet, Malzahar. Adam Harrington David Villegas, West Studio Loot eligible Festival View in 3D 520 12.02.2010 Reigning from his frozen throne on a lonely mountain, Kassadin prepares in secret for a special festival hidden deep in the icy wastes. Whether it's a winter sports festival, none can say… except for the attendees, who think he's being ridiculous. Adam Harrington Unknown artist Winter Sports Loot eligible Legacy Deep One View in 3D 520 01.08.2010 “Kassadin vanished at sea over fifty years ago. Whatever you saw down there—if you did see anything—it can't have been the same man I watched fall into the drink. And if it was… gods help us.” Adam Harrington Unknown artist Forgotten Depths Loot eligible Legacy Pre-Void View in 3D 520 26.09.2010 Adam Harrington Unknown artist Curse of the Void Loot eligible Harbinger View in 3D 975 13.07.2011 Kassadin swore vengeance on all gods, good and evil, of his world and of others, when his kingdom was destroyed by an errant thought. Forging armor from the remnants of an ancient living machine, he now sees himself growing closer towards the all-powerful beings he wishes to destroy. Adam Harrington Kienan 'Knockwurst' Lafferty Legacy Loot eligible Cosmic Reaver View in 3D 1350 14.10.2015 Born before the kindling of the stars, Kassadin stands alone in space's vast void. He watches over all things, a sentinel awaiting the end of this universe… and the beginning of the next. Adam Harrington Unknown artist Cosmic Loot eligible Voice filter New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Count View in 3D 1350 24.10.2019 A grim, lonely man who lives on a grim, lonely street, Kassadin is the one whom all kids avoid on All Hallows' Eve; for in his presence, there are no treats nor sweets to be found. Adam Harrington Sangsoo Jeong Trick-or-Treat Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Count Kassadin Chromas Aquamarine Citrine Emerald Obsidian Pearl Ruby Hextech View in 3D Special 15.10.2020 Engrossed in his work to the point of near-obsession, Kassadin vanished for some time into the bowels of his labyrinthian workshop, disappearing from public life for years. When he emerged, he revealed a shocking hextech innovation to the world: his own body, fully integrated with the technology he so loved. Adam Harrington Malex Zhang, Kudos Productions Hextech Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Shockblade View in 3D 1350 17.02.2022 As high priest of the Shockblade order, Kassadin has a deep connection to the Storm few understand, but all respect. It is the power of his station that allows the Shockblades to follow their targets in and out of the spirit realm, going where no one else can to protect the people under their charge. Adam Harrington Zoe Zhu, West Studio Shockblade Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Shockblade Kassadin Chromas Amethyst Catseye Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Turquoise Dragonmancer View in 3D 1350 09.01.2024 Kassadin scoured the world in search of a missing loved one. He mapped out a path in the stars, following a pattern of constellations only he could read—reaching an open field where the Astral Dragon recognized his purpose. Though his spirit darkens over the possibility his journey may never end, he now harnesses the dragon's brilliance to light his way. Adam Harrington Francis Tneh, West Studio Dragonmancers Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Dragonmancer Kassadin Chromas Amethyst Citrine Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] Kassadin's dance references the Sprinkler dance . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Kassadin's breathing might be referencing Darth Vader's from Star Wars . Kassadin has been disabled for every Ultra Rapid Fire edition except for Snow Battle ARURF . This is most likely because he would have been (and be) able to Riftwalk the entirety of Summoner's Rift in seconds. Kassadin was named after Jeff 'Kassadin' Jew , the Lead Producer of Legends of Runeterra . Ezreal , Ryze and Tryndamere are also named after Rioters' nicknames.
