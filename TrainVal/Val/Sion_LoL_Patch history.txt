Gameplay Collection Audio Patch history Past versions Current version [ ] V14.2 Glory in Death Bug Fix: Movement speed no longer decays faster if other effects forcing stat updates acted on him at the same time. V13.9 Glory in Death Base health cost per tick increased to 2. 3 − 24. 4 (based on level) from 2 − 19 (based on level) . V13.6 Unstoppable Onslaught Bug Fix: Crowd control immunity now properly resists allied crowd control as well. V13.1 Stats Base health increased to 655 from 615. Decimating Smash Maximum base damage increased to 90 / 155 / 220 / 285 / 350 from 70 / 135 / 200 / 265 / 330. V12.23 Stats Base mana increased to 400 from 330. Mana growth increased to 52 from 42. Decimating Smash Minimum base damage increased to 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 from 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 / 110. Maximum base damage unchanged. V12.16 Unstoppable Onslaught Bug Fix: Fixed an oversight where the server would still accept attack commands to alter Sion's otherwise-restricted movement. This fixes an exploit where cheaters could deliberately input these orders through their means to fully control Sion's movement. V12.14 General Bug Fix: No longer becomes unable to attack for 0. 25 seconds shortly after entering champion combat. Decimating Smash Bug Fix: No longer prevents Soul Furnace and its recast from being cast for a brief moment after releasing the charge. Roar of the Slayer Bug Fix: No longer locks Sion out of attacking, moving and casting movement spells for up-to 0. 25 seconds after the missile is fired. This fixes several bugs where non-crowd control effects that prevent Sion from attacking or moving (e.g. Decimating Smash , Teleport ) were having those disables ignored for 0. 25 seconds after the disable from Roar of the Slayer wore off. Moving during Decimating Smash for this reason cancelled the channel. Unstoppable Onslaught Bug Fix: Stun duration is no longer 0. 75 − 1. 75 (based on channel time) seconds instead of the normal 0. 25 − 1. 75 (based on channel time) when colliding with the recast leap . Bug Fix: Fixed an oversight where the server would still accept attack move commands to alter Sion's otherwise-restricted movement. This fixes an exploit where cheaters could deliberately input these orders through their means to fully control Sion's movement. Delayed attack move packets can thus also no longer change Sion's movement during Unstoppable Onslaught a single time. V12.12 Glory in Death Bug Fix: Corpse is no longer an obstacle to other units' pathing. V12.10 Stats Base health increased to 615 from 545. Health growth increased to 87 from 73. Armor growth increased to 4. 2 from 3. Magic resistance growth increased to 2. 05 from 1. 25 . Soul Furnace Shield health ratio reduced to 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12% maximum health from 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 / 14% . Roar of the Slayer Bug Fix: Can no longer knockback Rift Herald . This includes the player-summoned Rift Herald which is otherwise not immune to CC. (bug) V12.9 - May 11th Hotfix Glory in Death Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where he wasn't dealing reduced damage against structures despite displaying the correct numbers. V12.9 Glory in Death New Effect: Damage against structures is now reduced to 40% damage while in zombie form. This includes attacks as well as on-hit effects that can be applied to structures, such as Demolish , Titanic Hydra and the magic damage based on AP conversion based on adaptive force . This includes true damage from sources such as Elixir of Sorcery . (bug) Roar of the Slayer Bug Fix: Tooltip now displays the proper duration of the armor reduction debuff. V12.8 Glory in Death Bug Fix: Enemy champions that deal lethal damage to trigger the zombie state are no longer considered to deal damage to the source when the effect ends. V11.21 Soul Furnace Shield health ratio increased to 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 / 14% maximum health from 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12% . V11.20 Decimating Smash Undocumented/Bug Fix: Tooltip no longer incorrectly uses a higher AD ratio on ranks 2-5 of the damage calculation. Soul Furnace Undocumented/Bug Fix: Tooltip no longer incorrectly factors in Sion's maximum health as bonus damage on the recast's damage calculation. V11.19 Soul Furnace Shield strength increased to 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160 from 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150. V11.14 Glory in Death Bug Fix: Sterak's Gage's Lifeline no longer refreshes its readiness upon death, which caused it to always trigger again during Glory in Death even if on cooldown. V11.13 Glory in Death Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where the respawned Sion could be knocked back to his previous location by certain abilities, if Glory in Death lasted longer than his death timer's duration. Dr. Mundo's Blunt Force Trauma no longer pulls a vanished Sion from his respawn location. Urgot's Disdain no longer pulls respawned Sion if he is more than 2000 units away. Zac's Stretching Strikes still has this issue. V11.8 Unstoppable Onslaught Undocumented/New Effect: Now causes the player's HUD to become transparent during the channel. Bug Fix: Now properly knocks up really big targets. V11.3 Decimating Smash Bug Fix: Hitbox can no longer be manipulated to appear in a different location further away. V11.1 Stats Base magic resistance reduced to 32 from 32. 1 . V10.23 Roar of the Slayer Bug Fix: Is no longer able to regain control during certain types of disables for a moment shortly after casting Roar of the Slayer .

V10.12 Decimating Smash Bug Fix: Tooltip now properly indicates that his total attack damage modifier is increased by spent skill points. V10.5 Unstoppable Onslaught Bug Fix: Enemy champions hit by the charge are now correctly stunned for 0. 25 − 1. 75 (based on charge time) seconds instead of 0. 25 − 1. 25 (based on charge time) seconds. V9.22 Unstoppable Onslaught Bug Fix: When cast outside of its maximum range, Sion will no longer attempt to walk into cast range first. (Cast range increased from 7500 to 25000 units.) V9.21 Glory in Death Undocumented: When Sion dies again, he will now only briefly reveal areas in his vision range that are not obstructed by terrain or bush, instead of the entire radius. Roar of the Slayer Undocumented: Spell shields now correctly prevent the damage from being applied by a pushed minion. (Armor reduction is still applied incorrectly). V9.19 Soul Furnace Shield strength increased 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 from 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130. V9.16 Stats Base mana increased to 330 from 325. 6 . Base health increased to 545 from 542. 64 .
