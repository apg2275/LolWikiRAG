Original View in 3D 790 21.09.2010 Sona is Demacia’s foremost virtuoso of the stringed etwahl, speaking only through her graceful chords and vibrant arias. This genteel manner has endeared her to the highborn, though others suspect her spellbinding melodies to actually emanate magic—a Demacian taboo. Silent to outsiders but somehow understood by close companions, Sona plucks her harmonies not only to soothe injured allies, but also to strike down unsuspecting enemies. Erin Fitzgerald Shilin Huang Loot eligible Muse View in 3D 975 21.09.2010 Sona is a goddess of inspiration, compelling her worshippers to create profound works of art for all the world to see.

That's the duality of love: sometimes you win, sometimes you get cut in half by soundwaves.

Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] A Power Chord consists of a double root and the fifth, often heard in rock music. A Hymn (Greek: 'song of praises') is a type of song usually associated to religion. While Hymn of Valor's aura is active, the game's theme can be heard. An Aria is a type of melody usually associated with operas. Crescendo (Italian: 'growing') refers to the amplification of volume in music. In-game Crescendo triggers both a stun and the target(s)' dance emote simultaneously. Sona was deemed overpowered/obnoxious for Ultra Rapid Fire in April 2014, and was ultimately disabled in non-custom games. At one time, Sona held the title of lowest base Armor (9). Sona's Deutsch/German title, Die Virtuosin , is the feminine derivative of Jhin's title, Der Virtuose . Enemy champions hit by Crescendo will be forced to dance while they are stunned.
