If Looming Darkness triggers Doom , enemies hit will flee from the epicenter instead. Doom's cooldown resets upon respawning . Innate - Gloom: Nearby enemy champions and monsters that dash or blink will be marked with Gloom for 6 seconds. Vex's next basic attack , which becomes non-projectile , or basic ability hit against an enemy with Gloom will detonate the mark. Looming Darkness will also inflict Gloom , but cannot detonate it. Gloom's detonation deals 30 − 140 (based on level) (+ 20% AP) bonus magic damage and refunds 25% of Doom's cooldown. Against non-champions, this instead deals 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% (based on level) damage and refunds 10% of Doom's cooldown. Link ▶️ ( Doom charged) "Ugghh..." Link ▶️ ( Gloom triggered) "Bring it down a notch." Hide Details Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage Magic Counters Spell shield Parries Projectile See Notes Blocked Not Blocked Gloom will mark Rift Herald and Rift Scuttler when they use their dashes. Gloom can mark clones , but not other pets . Gloom's mark has a very brief cooldown and refreshes on subsequent dashes or blinks nearby enemies use. Gloom's mark duration will refresh to 0. 5 seconds when Vex starts an attack windup against a target that has a mark which is about to expire. Gloom will mark enemies even if they are untargetable . Gloom will mark enemies that are inside the detection radius when they blink, but will not mark those that blink inside from far away. (bug) Doom's cooldown starts as soon as the basic ability is cast. Non-champions (e.g. Rift Scuttler ) are not knocked down by the fear-empowered ability. (bug) Spell shield will block all of Doom's effects but not Gloom's empowered attack nor mark. Nearby enemies that become displaced do not count for being marked by Gloom .

Original View in 3D 975 23.09.2021 In the black heart of the Shadow Isles, a lone yordle trudges through the spectral fog, content in its murky misery. With an endless supply of teen angst and a powerful shadow in tow, Vex lives in her own self-made slice of gloom, far from the revolting cheer of the “normie” world. Though she lacks ambition, she is quick to strike down color and happiness, stopping all would-be interlopers with her magical malaise. Jeannie Tirado Horace 'Hozure' Hsu Loot eligible Dawnbringer View in 3D 1350 23.09.2021 Vex finds order in the day's descent to darkness, and spends her evenings watching her shadow chase the sun below the horizon. A preternaturally sour and unenthusiastic god, she finds the whole chaos and order 'thing' very blasé.

Growing up alone, she was self-sufficient and annoyed by most people. Her realm's destruction barely made her blink, but her new Empyrean powers did give her an idea. By empowering her own shadow, she finally had a companion she tolerated. Vex may not need anyone, but then again, misery loves company.
