The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and triggering Force Pulse's passive. Recasting the ability does not. Mimic: Distortion has the same properties. Distortion and Mimic: Distortion have independent return pads and LeBlanc can travel to both while they are active. Distortion's pad duration starts once the dash ends. Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit AP ratio changed to 70% AP . Cooldown changed to 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 / 8 seconds.

Original View in 3D 790 02.11.2010 Mysterious even to other members of the Black Rose cabal, LeBlanc is but one of many names for a pale woman who has manipulated people and events since the earliest days of Noxus. Using her magic to mirror herself, the sorceress can appear to anyone, anywhere, and even be in many places at once. Always plotting just out of sight, LeBlanc’s true motives are as inscrutable as her shifting identity.

Thus did they fall upon the great forest, and slaughter its children… until a lone sylvan stood against them, stealing the witches' lives, their magic, and even their names.

Carrie Keranen Exia Xiaotong, West Studio Bewitching Loot eligible Legacy New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Bewitching LeBlanc Chromas Catseye Emerald Obsidian Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] LeBlanc is voiced by Carrie Keranen in League of Legends and Legends of Runeterra . [2] Lux , Elementalist Lux , Cosmic Lux and Dark Cosmic Lux are also voiced by the same voice actress. LeBlanc is the first champion to have a Loading screen and Portrait icon not focus the actual champion, in her case, focus on her Mimic . The second one is Jhin , focus on the mirror image. The same case applies for some of her skins: Prestigious , Elderwood , Program and Coven . Mimic used to be the only ability (currently Relentless Pursuit , Inferno Trigger and Purge ) that ended up costing 0 mana when fully-ranked. LeBlanc is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin. When she uses Mirror Image , her clone will be of a different colour palette which can only be seen by LeBlanc and her allies. To the opposing team, the two LeBlancs look exactly the same, including copies of any external buffs and item effects active at the moment the clone is spawned (Prior to patch V5.22 , clones did not duplicate external buff/active item effect particles). Four other champions with this feature are Wukong (via Warrior Trickster ), Shaco's (via Hallucinate ), Nasus (via Fury of the Sands ) and Malphite (via Granite Shield and Thunderclap ). The Black Rose might have been inspired by and/or might be referencing the Black Hand . Her staff appears to be inspired, partially or in full, by that of Tsukasa from .hack//SIGN. The name 'LeBlanc' may be a reference to Maurice Leblanc , creator of the character Arsène Lupin . Like Lupin, part of LeBlanc's character is that of a master of disguise.
