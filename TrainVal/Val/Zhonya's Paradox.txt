Similar items Banshee's Veil Luden's Echo Rabadon's Deathcap Notes Item VFX Despite the fact that the user cannot cast active items during Zhonya's Hourglass , Quicksilver is put on a 0. 5 -second static cooldown . Zhonya's Hourglass does not break stealth . While the stasis is active, any pets the user currently has (e.g. Annie's Summon: Tibbers ) can still be issued commands. Strategy Zhonya's Hourglass is most effectively used against abilities that have a downtime before they can affect the target ( Chum the Waters , Unleashed Power , Death Mark ). It is best used offensively and defensively with aura-type abilities ( Fiddlesticks' Crowstorm , Morgana's Soul Shackles ) which do not require channeling. This is particularly powerful when used in the middle of the enemy team, allowing them to continue to deal damage as area of effect while being untargetable . Trivia Zhonya's Hourglass resulted from the separation of the offensive and defensive abilities of the removed item Zhonya's Ring . This is the defensive item; Rabadon's Deathcap is the offensive item. The " Hourglass " in the name is a reference to the fact that by using its active ability, you are granted a few more seconds to live. Within those few seconds, your cooldowns will continue to drop and your team may come to help you. It is a reference to many magic hourglass fantasy like Sands Of Time or Hourglass of Time .
