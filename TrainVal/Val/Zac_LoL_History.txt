Enemies can move over these chunks to destroy them while Zac can do so to consume them and restore 4% maximum health . Upon taking fatal damage , Zac splits into 4 uncontrollable bloblets that move to his final location over 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level) seconds. If any of these bloblets remain at the end of the duration, Zac recombines and returns at 10 - 50% maximum health (based on his bloblets' total remaining health ) Zac's size scales with his current health , getting larger when it exceeds his base health (based on level) and getting smaller the higher his missing health . Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Cell Division is an on-spell effect with an on-death effect component. Cell Division's chunks spawn in two versions. Contestable: They will fall to the ground between Zac and the nearest visible enemy champion within 1000 range of him (dropping slightly in Zac's favor) Cannot be interacted with for the first 0. 25 seconds (except during Let's Bounce! ) Uncontestable: They will fall to the ground near Zac and can be picked up immediately (version used by default) Cell Division's chunk pick-up radius is the same for both Zac and enemy champions. Zac's abilities cost 4% current health while chunks restore 4% maximum health (net healing equals 4% missing health ) Guardian Angel and Chronoshift will take precedence over Cell Division .
