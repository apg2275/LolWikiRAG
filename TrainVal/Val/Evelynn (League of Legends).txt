Attacking or casting abilities ends Demon Shade immediately and places it on a 4-second static cooldown , reduced to 1. 25 seconds from casting Last Caress . Taking damage from champions or turrets interrupts Demon Shade and places it on a 1. 5 -second static cooldown . Demon Shade: While below 250 − 590 (based on level) (+ 250% AP) health , Evelynn heals herself for 15 − 150 (based on level) every second. From level 6 onward, Demon Shade also grants camouflage . Link ▶️ "It's better in the dark." Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Demon Shade is also placed on a 1. 5 second cooldown upon respawning . Demon Shade's cooldown incurs upon starting the attack windup of the basic attack and upon the cast time of the ability. Demon Shade activates even if Evelynn is Recalling . Whenever Demon Shade activates, a puff of purple smoke will briefly appear around her.

Recast: Evelynn unleashes a line of deadly spikes in the direction of the nearest visible enemy that deals magic damage to all enemies struck. Magic Damage: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 (+ 30% AP) Maximum Magic Damage: 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 / 135 (+ 90% AP) Total Magic Damage: 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 / 330 (+ 195% AP) Hate Spike's recast prioritizes targeting Evelynn's attack target, then the nearest enemy champion, then the nearest non-champion. A nearby visible enemy is required to recast this ability.

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time. Recasts can be buffered up to 0. 5 seconds before becoming castable at a maximum range of approximately 500 units. Map-Specific Differences Ultra Rapid Fire differences edit Recast can now be used up to 10 times instead of 3. * Arena differences edit Dart base damage changed to 35 / 45 / 55 / 65 / 75.

Video Edit Allure Allure COST: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Mana COOLDOWN : 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 CAST TIME: 0. 25 TARGET RANGE: 1200 / 1300 / 1400 / 1500 / 1600 Active: Evelynn curses the target enemy champion or medium or large monster for 5 seconds. Evelynn's next basic attack or ability against the accursed target expunges them, slowing them by 65% for 0. 75 seconds. Expunging a target will refund Allure's mana cost . If the target is cursed for at least 2. 5 seconds, the expunge also charms them for a few seconds and the duration of the slow is increased to last for this time, as well as applying additional effects based on the target type. Charm Duration: 1. 25 / 1. 5 / 1. 75 / 2 / 2. 25 Monster Duration: 3. 25 / 3. 5 / 3. 75 / 4 / 4. 25 Against champions, the expunge also inflicts magic resistance reduction for 4 seconds. Against monsters, the expunge deals bonus magic damage and the charm lasts 2 seconds longer. Magic Resistance Reduction: 35 / 37. 5 / 40 / 42. 5 / 45% Bonus Magic Damage: 250 / 300 / 350 / 400 / 450 (+ 60% AP) Casting Allure does not break Demon Shade nor its fade into it.

Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Spell damage Magic Counters Spell shield See Notes The mark fully forming signifies the 2. 5 seconds have elapsed, meaning the charm will be applied on the triggering attack or ability. An enemy champion cursed by Allure is alarmed of her presence and after the mark has fully formed, an arrow will appear next to them pointing towards Evelynn's direction. This is visible to both teams. The magic penetration will be applied to the attack or ability that triggers it. Allure's mark application on a target cannot be blocked by spell shield . The expunge will not occur if the ability is blocked by a spell shield. The mark does not trigger and will remain on the target in this case. The magic resistance reduction debuff is applied independently of the Charm debuff when the matured mark is expunged, meaning a target can still have their magic resistance reduced while they are resisting applications of CC debuffs (e.g. Morgana's Black Shield ). If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but still go on cooldown and pay its cost. (bug) Allure will restart its cooldown whenever the mark debuff is removed. (bug) Map-Specific Differences Arena differences edit Cooldown changed to 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 seconds.

Gaining Demon Shade resets Whiplash's cooldown and empowers its next cast. The damage based on the target's health ratio for both Whiplash and its empowered cast deals a minimum of 25 and is capped at 450 against monsters . Edit Empowered Whiplash Empowered Whiplash Active: Evelynn dashes toward the target enemy with her lashers, dealing increased damage to them upon completion as well as to all enemies within her path. Empowered Magic Damage: 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 / 175 (+ 4% (+ 2. 5 % per 100 AP) of target's maximum health) Empowered Whiplash only applies on-hit effects to the primary target.

Original View in 3D 585 30.04.2009 Within the dark seams of Runeterra, the demon Evelynn searches for her next victim. She lures in prey with the voluptuous façade of a human female, but once a person succumbs to her charms, Evelynn’s true form is unleashed. She then subjects her victim to unspeakable torment, gratifying herself with their pain. To the demon, these liaisons are innocent flings. To the rest of Runeterra, they are ghoulish tales of lust gone awry and horrific reminders of the cost of wanton desire.
