Mythic Content In: Prestige Star Guardian Neeko Prestige Conqueror Jax Mythic Chroma and icon for Galaxy Slayer Zed Out: Prestige Bewitching Miss Fortune Prestige Coven LeBlanc Mythic Chroma and icon for High Noon Senna Game [ ] Level ups Recommended level ups for abilities on champions are now provided. These will indicate which abilities are typically ranked up at each level and will be updated once a patch based on what is currently optimal. Visual indicators will appear once you have a skill point available and will highlight the recommended ability that should be ranked up. Monsters Visual leashing indicators are now displayed to show how far jungle camps can be pulled before their patience starts diminishing. Distance for jungle monsters to be pulled from their camps has been decreased. Jungle paths Jungle path recommendations for the first clear now offered for every champion. First clear paths were determined by gathering data from high skilled junglers on their high mastery champs across the globe. Pathing recommendations are based on which routes most often led these players to a victory and will be updated each patch. These recommendations are displayed on the mini-map and visually above camps, indicating the recommended order of your first clear. Objective voting A new voting function has been added that will appear when objectives such as Dragon are pinged, similarly to a surrender vote. All players can vote and indicate whether or not they would like to take or contest that objective. Jungler's vote counts as two votes and a total of 4 votes for or against will be considered aligned. Pings Ping wheel user interface has been updated. New icons and indicators for Caution , Retreat (formerly Danger ), On My Way , Assist Me , and Enemy Missing . New pings have been added to the ping wheel, including Push , All-In , Hold , and Bait . Another ping wheel has been added primarily for vision pings, which include Vision Cleared , Enemy Vision , and Need Vision . The Need Vision ping leaves behind a small persistent indicator that lasts for a minute or until a ward is placed nearby. Only one of these indicators may be active at a time, and using this ping again overrides the previous one. A ping not visible on the screen is now notified based on which direction it came from by displaying it on the edge of the screen. Enemy Missing pings will show on your screen regardless of where they are pinged on the map while Retreat , On My Way , Assist Me , Hold , All-In , and Push pings will only be displayed if they are pinged within 3000 units (approximately corner to corner of your screen when fully zoomed out) of your screen’s edge. Pinging a ward within the lasts 10 seconds of an enemy placing it, or attacking it, will now cause an accurate timer for that ward to appear until it is destroyed or has expired. New ward visuals are now displayed on the minimap that will indicate when wards are close to expiring. They will change appearance when wards reach a third of their remaining duration. Remake Before 3:00, if a player is within the spawn for 90 consecutive seconds, their team is able to initiate a remake. At 45 seconds, this player will receive a message in the chat informing them that they need to leave the spawn. If they still haven't done so after 25 seconds, they will receive a pop-up message with the same reminder. Settings Bug Fix: Enabling Auto attack no longer sometimes cancel channeled abilities.
