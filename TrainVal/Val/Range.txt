Range is a value that defines how far a basic attack , ability , summoner spell , and item active can reach. Range is defined in an arbitrary quantities of "units". It shares the scale of "units" with movement speed , so one point translates to one game distance unit traveled. Note that basic attack range is defined differently than ability range. Given a source unit's hitbox and a target unit's hitbox, range is calculated as follows: basic attack range from edge to edge; targeted skill range from center to center (barring exceptions); skillshot range from center to edge * ; and the range of self-centered area of effects are from the center of the source (the larger champions benefit slightly less from most auras than smaller champions). The difference is approximately 125 (i.e. 550 basic attack range is roughly 675 casting range ) [1] [2] [3] Each champion begins the game with a particular base basic attack range. This can vary from 125 to 325 for melee units and 350 to 650 for ranged units. As of V9.24 , Aphelios (while his main weapon is Calibrum ) and Caitlyn have the highest base basic attack range at level 1 with 650. The highest possible range is held by Senna , whose passive, Absolution , allows her range to scale indefinitely.

Alistar's Headbutt reduces his attack range by 500 to -375 during the dash, to prevent him from being able to attack the target when he completes the dash.
