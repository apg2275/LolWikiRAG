"You belong in a museum!" This article or section may contain obsolete information, but exists here for historical purposes. Spectator Mode , once known as the summoner spell Observer , is a mode in League of Legends that allows a player to watch but not physically take part in a game. It was first introduced at the Season One Championship but since its release it has seen little use. On November 10, 2011, it was reintroduced to custom games for beta testing, and has since been implemented into normal games but with its limits to prevent any cheating among players.

Spectator Mode is different from a normal player's perspective in a number of ways. For starters, a spectating player has no champion to command or team affiliation. Instead, he is able to jump to the perspective of either team, following the action as they see it. A spectator can even choose to remove the fog of war altogether for a global view of the battlefield. Additionally, the spectator is able to quickly and easily access information on either team such as in-game stats, item builds, gold totals, and ability cooldowns. Ghosting [ ] For the summoner spell, see Ghost Ghosting is a term coined by definition when a summoner observes a stream in an attempt to gain advantage against an opponent. There are many methods of doing this, with some of the most popular including having a friend open the stream and relay the information by mouth or over VoIP (Voice over IP). Another widely used method includes running a Smurf account on a separate computer and having the stream open and viewable. Despite having an initial 3-minute delay, it is possible to view the match(es) live, thus the introduction of Ghosting. Spectator mode can be an excellent tool for those players interested in learning more about the basics of League of Legends gameplay, or for those who wish to commentate over live competitive play.

Spectator Mode UI [ ] Team Fight User Interface [ ] With the introduction of Patch V3.11 , a new interface has been developed for spectator mode. “ We've developed a new Team Fight UI for spectator mode that minimizes and concentrates the UI so that it's easier to focus on the action during team fights. With this change we've optimized the display of battle information in team fights, including who's involved in the fight, who's winning, and how many people have died on either team. — Chris 'Pwyff' Tom Some of the new features of the UI include: While spectating, press 'A' to toggle the Team Fight UI Minimalist UI mode that focuses on presenting information relevant to on-screen conflicts Team health bars communicate the momentum of the fight and impact of AoE damage Crowd control indicators visualize the power of crowd control abilities Pentakill counter tracks progress towards double, triple, quadra and pentakills Components of the new Team Fight User Interface Spectator Mode UI VS Team Fight UI [ ] Standard Spectator Mode Interface New Team Fight User Interface Spectator Mode UI VS Team Fight UI [ ] Updated Key Bindings, reflecting Patch 3.11 updates The hotkey Ctrl-Shift-Z (on QWERTY keyboards) unlocks the zoom on the spectator camera. You can add certain lines of code to your config files to enable extra functionality inside of the spectator, like a camera with unlocked zoom, or changing the neutral monster timers to appear like they do in professional Esports matches.
To unlock your camera, Open the file path Riot Games > League Of Legends > Config > PersistedSettings. Once you're editing this file, search for "Input.ini" and under GameEvents Settings, add the following:
{ "name": "evtToggleExtendedZoom", "value": "[Ctrl][z]" }, After doing this, using the hotkey Ctrl+Z in spectate will allow you to zoom in and out as much as you want. To turn the neutral timers into the dragon and baron timers used in pro play, open the game.cfg file in the same config folder. Simply add "[Spectator] eSportsNeutralTimers=1" and when you enable the timers in spectate will appear as they do on the professional streams. External links [ ] Spectator F.A.Q. Patch 3.11
