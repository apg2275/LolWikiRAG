This enchantment resembles a removed item named Madred's Bloodrazor . Not only do they have a similar name, but their passives are similar, with the difference that Madred's Bloodrazor 's passive dealt magic damage , while Bloodrazor deals physical damage . Being physical damage instead of magic damage means it has better synergy with armor penetration , allowing it to scale better into the late game. However, it is worse early, since most champions have more armor than magic resistance early and it is easier to itemize for armor .
