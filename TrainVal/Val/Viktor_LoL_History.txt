Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Projectile Blocked Death Ray has no cast time and Viktor may freely act while the ray is travelling. Sight is granted in a medium area around the beam while it travels. Although this vision will not go through bushes or across walls, it will reveal all champions within its radius even if they are hiding in a bush or are across a wall. There is a known graphical bug in which the beam's visual-effect is stuck on the place in which it was originally cast, but the damaging part of the ability performs normally, damaging units in the intended location. If Viktor dies while he is firing the beam it will become interrupted and deal damage up to the location where it was in the moment Viktor died. The augmented damage over time is unaffected by this if it has already been applied. Relative to basic The Hex Core - Gold efficiency 45 ability power = 978. 75 Augment: Death 's passive must be worth 21. 25 for it to be gold efficient. Chaos Storm Chaos Storm COST: 100 mana COOLDOWN: 120 RANGE: 700 Active: Viktor conjures a chaos storm at the target location, dealing magic damage and silencing enemies in the area for 0. 5 seconds.

Hide Details Info Targeting input Chaos Storm is a ground-targeted area of effect with a summon component. Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Projectile Blocked Radius of initial impact: 250. Radius of zone: 350. Damage interval: 0. 25 seconds. Chaos Storm can be controlled by Alt + Right-Click or by pressing the R button ( default hotkeys ). It can be commanded to move toward locations or enemy champions ( it will continue to follow the chosen enemy champion unless commanded otherwise ). If Viktor is affected by hard-CC he cannot issue new commands to the storm. If the champion the storm is currently following enters stealth , the storm will continue to follow them, effectively giving away their position. The storm grants sight around its position for the full duration. Including the initial damage ( Both the base damage and a tick of the persistent damage ), Chaos Storm deals 28 instance of damage. Rylai's Crystal Scepter will apply a 15% slow on each instance of damage dealt. Chaos Storm remains active and continues to deal damage if Viktor dies before the storm ends. When Viktor dies, the storm immediately stops moving and cannot be subsequently redirected. Probable Bug: If Chaos Storm is summoned in a brush where the enemy has no vision, it will remain invisible to the enemy team for its duration even if it is redirected out of the bush. Aside from when the bug occurs, Chaos Storm will be visible to enemies for its duration even if it enters a brush or the fog of war .
