There is one support item that generates gold, meaning it is not present as a reward anywhere else in the game and only exists for their user. This item increases passive gold generation , but its main objective requires and rewards active participation and engagement in the lane, either against enemy minions or enemy champions. Contents 1 Types 2 Gold per 10 seconds 3 Duo 4 Notes 5 References 6 List of Items Types [ ] There is two ways to actively generate gold. Completing the quest objective upgrades the item. World Atlas (tier 1) and Runic Compass (tier 2) Minion sharing: Requiress the support to take part in minion killing. It rewards sticking to another allied champion. One charge is provided every 18 seconds. Poking: Requires interaction with the enemy champions in order to maximize gold gains. Most of the gold is awarded for combat. It can be difficult to maximize its potential, because an enemy champion needs to be damaged with an ability or basic attack every 18 seconds. Gold per 10 seconds [ ] The following calculations do not take into account the base gold generation that all players in a game may passively gain. Minimum: The user is only benefiting from the item's gold per 10. Maximum: The user maximizes the item's potential gold. Gold income (gold per 10 seconds) Item Minimum Maximum World Atlas 3 Melee: 19. 66 Ranged: 18. 55 Runic Compass 5 Melee: 23. 88 Ranged: 22. 77 Bounty of Worlds (and its upgrades) 5 5 Duo [ ] Building support items on two champions sharing the same lane is not viable anymore since V9.23 because all support items grant reduced gold from minions after excessive minion farming, resulting in an overall deficit of gold. Notes [ ] The precursor to this series of items were the Philosopher's Stone , Heart of Gold , Kage's Lucky Pick , and Avarice Blade . They were changed so that each item's effect was unique and exclusive to each other in V1.0.0.120 . However the first edition of the support items as they currently appear was in Patch V3.14 in 2013, with the "Favor", "Spoils of War", and "Tribute" named item effects . In patch V9.23 , these items were reworked significantly. The patch introduced item variants with different stats, added a penalty to last-hit income in order to discourage multiple champions buying these items, removed the Ancient Coin (the "Favor" line of items), and removed the requirement to combine the items with a Sightstone in order to carry Wards, because of Watchful Wardstone and its upgrade Vigilant Wardstone .
