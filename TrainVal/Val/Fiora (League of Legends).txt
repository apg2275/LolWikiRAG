Vitals take 1. 75 seconds to become targetable and linger for 13. 25 seconds afterwards while Fiora remains near the target, otherwise the Vital will disappear. After a Vital ends, Fiora identifies a new one on her target. Dealing damage in the direction of a Vital will trigger it to deal bonus true damage equal to 3% (+ 4% per 100 bonus AD) of target's maximum health , heal Fiora for 35 − 100 (based on level) , and grant her 20 / 30 / 40 / 50% (based on Grand Challenge's Rank) bonus movement speed that decays over 1. 85 seconds. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type Proc damage True Counters Spell shield Parries Not Blocked Blocked Vitals can be triggered by any source of damage Fiora deals, except those with default damage and reactive damage types. The Vitals are visible to all units. A Vital's angle is fixed to the champion's model and doesn't interact with its orientation. Vitals spawn directions alternate in a Northeast-Southwest pattern. Other than that, they have a 50% chance to spawn North or East, or South or West, respectively. PENDING FOR TEST: The direction of the first Vital upon Fiora and her enemy encountering one another in the game for the first time is always South- or Westward. This is regardless of whether Fiora is in the Blue or Red team. Vitals will not trigger if the attack is dodged or missed while Fiora is blinded . Block will not prevent a trigger. If the Vital is triggered by Lunge , it can be dodged , but it can't be blocked and will trigger even if Fiora is blinded .

Lunge can hit structures and wards . Stabbing a target reduces Lunge's cooldown by 50%. The stab deals physical damage and applies on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness. Physical Damage: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 (+ 90 / 95 / 100 / 105 / 110% bonus AD) Fiora can cast any of her abilities during the dash. The target does not have to be visible to be hit by this ability. Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Location Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro Basic damage Physical Drawn Counters Spell shield Parries Grounded Blocked See Notes Disabled Knockdown Interrupted Lunge's dash speed is modified by her bonus movement speed at the time of cast: 1100 + 350% bonus movement speed , capped at 1600 maximum dash speed if bonus movement speed is positive. 1100 + 300% bonus movement speed , capped at 850 minimum dash speed if bonus movement speed is negative. Fiora does not stab if the dash is interrupted . Flash gets sealed during the dash so Fiora cannot interrupt herself with it. This also means she cannot buffer Flash during the dash for it to be cast right afterward, however. Fiora can cast Hextech Rocketbelt during the dash, potentially interrupting it based on the timing, preventing the stab if it does. The dash can pass through walls. The dash has no forgiveness mechanic to clear distant or wider walls with. Any wall wider than 400 units is not crossable. The stab searches for targets in its radius and prioritizes in order of: Nearest enemy champion affected by Grand Challenge with a Vital facing Fiora . Nearest enemy champion Vital facing Fiora . Nearest enemy champion affected by Grand Challenge Enemy champion with the lowest percent health out of all champions <20% remaining health. Nearest enemy champion, minion, or monster within 60% of the radius ( 252) with current health below Lunge's raw damage. Nearest enemy champion in the radius check. Nearest champion in a rectangular check with 160 width and 450 units length backwards from Fiora's current facting direction, ignoring the normal radius check. Turning Fiora's facing direction during the dash (e.g. by casting Riposte ) can create some very long range hits opposite to her new facing direction, especially against targets with a large gameplay radius. (bug) Nearest enemy minion with current health below Lunge's raw damage. Any nearest enemy minion or monster. Structures. Wards. Lunge will not attempt to strike jungle plants . Lunge deals basic damage , but also triggers spell effects by also being tagged as spell damage . Lunge cannot critically strike . Lunge won't deal damage, if the spell is dodged or blocked , but will deal damage if Fiora is blinded . Lunge does not apply on-attack effects apart from certain exceptions. It does apply Energized as if it was an on-hit effect. It does not stack Guinsoo's Rageblade nor trigger Phantom Hit.

Additionally, over the first 0. 6 seconds of the duration, Fiora poises to strike, after which she sends a shock with her sword in a line in the target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemies hit until colliding with an enemy champion. Magic Damage: 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 / 270 (+ 100% AP) The enemy champion struck is also slowed and crippled by 50% for 2 seconds. If Riposte negates at least one hostile immobilizing effect, Fiora stuns the target for the same duration instead. Link ▶️ (Upon blocking an immobilizing effect) "One step ahead!" Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Video Info Targeting input Direction Damage type Type Sub-type Area damage Magic Counters Spell shield Projectile Blocked Blocked Riposte is not invulnerability but instead reduces any damage to her by 100% late into the damage event. Because of this, it interacts differently with effects triggered from damage: Life steal and Healing based on damage dealt (Vamp) will still have effect even if the damage is ultimately ignored by Riposte . Shields will absorb damage before Riposte takes effect. Fiora cannot be executed by Pyke's Death from Below during Riposte but she can by Aspect of the Dragon . Riposte will not negate allied crowd control . Riposte will not negate nearsight . Immobilizing effects include those from Blast Cone (only if triggered by an enemy) and epic monsters . Debuff immunity includes summoner spells , such as Exhaust and Ignite , as well as damage over time and other effects. Riposte is and is not prioritized over certain effects: Riposte will block effects before spell shields . Black Shield will negate crowd control before Riposte . Riposte will not be able to apply its stun , as it requires Riposte to negate the immobilize and not any other external source to do so. Spell shield will also prevent Vitals from being triggered by Riposte .

Additional Bonus Movement Speed: 10 / 20 / 30% Active: Fiora challenges the target enemy champion for 8 seconds, highlighting all four of their Vitals after a 0. 5 -second delay. While in effect, Duelist's Dance does not identify new Vitals on Fiora's target. While near the target, Fiora gains Duelist's Dance's bonus movement speed . If Fiora triggers at least one Vital before the target dies , or triggers all four, she creates a Victory Zone at their location for 2 − 5 (based on Vitals hit) seconds, which heals Fiora and all allies within the area every second. Heal per Tick: 75 / 100 / 125 (+ 60% bonus AD) Maximum Heal: 375 / 500 / 625 (+ 300% bonus AD) Unlike Duelist's Dance , the Vitals will continue to linger even if Fiora is not nearby.

Even if Fiora dies, the Victory Zone will trigger so long as she hit at least one Vital and they die before the Vitals wear off. Resurrection effects will not prevent the activation of the Victory Zone . Ally units in stasis will not be healed by the Victory Zone . Fiora will automatically attack the target upon casting if the target was selected while they weren't in range of the ability. Tips & Tricks If the target stays very close to terrain they can prevent Fiora from hitting all vitals.

Karen Strassman also voices her in Legends of Runeterra . [2] Fiora's fighting style references Fencing while she herself might have been inspired by Julie d'Aubigny . [3] Her taunt references the 'salute' from duel tradition. In her joke, Fiora draws Teemo's face in the air. Her dance references Fred Astaire's to the tune of Puttin' On the Ritz in Blue Skies . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Fiora derives from Sabine theonym Flora , from Proto-Italic *flōs [4] plus feminine suffix -a . Her name might be referencing Fiore dei Liberi and/or Fioretto (Italian: 'foil') Her house's name is a reference to Nicolo Laurent , former CEO of Riot Games. Alex 'Skribbles' Yee chose his surname without even telling him and because he was " the only french person he knows ". Having become CEO years after, Laurent only discovered this easter egg during the production of Legends of Runeterra . [5] Riposte and 4 Fiora's Riposte / 4 Riposte are named after the eponymous fencing move , but its effect is more akin to a Parry , alongside a Riposte.
