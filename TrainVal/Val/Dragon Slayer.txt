Chemtech Blight Cloudbringer's Grace Hextech Prowess Infernal Might Mountainous Vigor Oceanic Will Stats Duration Permanent Source Dragon Affect Team Dragon Slayer is a team-wide stacking neutral buff granted by the Dragon . It is available only on Summoner's Rift . Slaying a dragon will grant a buff based on the element of the dragon slain; that buff can stack up to four times for a given element, and a team can possess more than one type of buff. However, only three types of elemental drakes will spawn on the map, due to the first two drakes consisting of two elemental types and all drakes thereafter spawning as the elemental type dependent on the element that dominates the rift. This means that in a given game, only the buff granted by the rift-dominant element can be stacked. These buffs are permanent and are granted to the entire team of the player who killed the dragon. Elemental Dragons hold an Ancient Grudge for enemies who have slain their kin; they gain 20% bonus damage and 7% damage reduction against champions per stack of Dragon Slayer they have, up to 80% bonus damage and 28% damage reduction at 4 stacks.

This effect does not trigger from its own damage. Damaging an enemy champion below 20% of their maximum health while Aspect of the Dragon's buff is active blasts them with Elder Immolation after 0. 5 seconds, executing them, which destroys all shields before dealing 100% of their current health as true damage . Elder Immolation cannot occur on the same target from any of its buff holders more than once every 2 seconds. Elder Immolation cannot execute units with invulnerability or a minimum health threshold , but can execute through untargetability .

Trivia [ ] Ultimate Spellbook released with a unique Ruined Dragon using Mordekaiser's dragon from Children of the Grave that was then supplanted by Hextech Drake & Chemtech Drake in V11.23 . It granted a dragon soul similar to Chemtech Drake.

For Shyvana , Cloudbringer's Grace instead granted her 10 / 23. 33 / 36. 67 / 50% (based on stacks) increased Fury generation. For Udyr , Cloudbringer's Grace granted him 6 / 12 / 18 / 24 (based on stacks) haste on his global cooldown between stance swaps. Until patch V9.23 each component of Dragon Slayer had a passive name and an alternate name, related to the drake: Cloud Drake's was Stratus Walk and Dragon's Flight . Infernal Drake's was Infernal Tribute and Dragon's Might . Ocean Drake's was Heart of Oceans and Dragon's Dominance . Mountain Drake's was Earthen Arms and Dragon's Wrath .
