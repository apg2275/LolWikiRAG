Strategy Ardent Censer synergizes well with other healing and shielding sources, especially with those with either wide area of effect or with low cooldown. Being able to also grant bonus attack speed and on-hit damage drastically increases the item's offensive power as well. The item's passive can be applied to multiple champions at a time, meaning area of effect heals or shields can grant the buff to the entire team. Champions that can utilize the attack speed and on-hit damage due to using lots of basic attacks for their damage output, like Kayle , Kog'Maw , and Master Yi , and especially so on those who purchase Runaan's Hurricane and Guinsoo's Rageblade , will find the passive to be very valuable. Old icons 1st version Trivia A censer is "a container in which incense is burned, typically during a religious ceremony". The bonus on-hit magic damage given by the item's passive appears as a critical strike for the wielder, but appears as standard magic damage for the buffed ally. Media Item VFX Item VFX
