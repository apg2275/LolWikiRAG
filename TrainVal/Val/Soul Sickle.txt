Similar items Arcane Helix Notes The mana restoration passive triggers as an On-hit effect . Abilities that apply on-hit, such as Ezreal's Mystic Shot and Gangplank's Parrrley will trigger the passive. It will therefore also not apply when attacking a turret. Strategy This item comes in useful for champions who are AD based, cast spells constantly but also perform autoattacks often, abusing both the mana restore and lifesteal, for example Jayce , Gangplank , (top lane) Udyr , Ezreal , Sivir or Poppy . Trivia Soul Sickle was briefly introduced on the PBE server in the Preseason 2015 patch. Due to a mistake, it did not build into Essence Reaver.
