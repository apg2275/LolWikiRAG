In Aurelion Sol's case, Stardust stacks gained through Cosmic Creator permanently increases Breath of Light 's bonus magic damage , Astral Flight 's range, Singularity 's outer and inner radius and execution threshold and Falling Star and The Skies Descend 's effect radius. The Skies Descend was named after his champion spell of the same 15 name in Legends of Runeterra . In 'Aurelion Sol: The Star Forger Returns' his hand gesture resembles the old Riot Games Inc. fist intro. A lot of his animations and visual effects were inspired by celestial objects and atoms . Aurelion Sol's lower body is not part of his in-game hitbox , which is why it is semi-transparent. A demonstration can be seen here . Prior to his CGU, in Ultra Rapid Fire his Center of the Universe passive used to have 6 stars orbiting around him with increased speed, simply by leveling up. Interestingly, this is the only non-stat modification made to any champion in URF, suggesting this may have originally been an intended feature which was scrapped from the champion before release. The name of the concept character from which Aurelion Sol spurred from, ​​​​​​ Ao Shin , could be a reference to Ao Qin , the Dragon King of the South Sea .
