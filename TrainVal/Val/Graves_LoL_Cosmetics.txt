[1] This change was once implemented in all regions, including those with lighter censorship policies. Because of this, the meme of the missing "Grave's Cigar" became popular when players compared frivolous visual changes. This change is implemented by default, then automatically overwritten by the original art in safer regions. The collection catalog is the only place in the client where Graves properly has his cigar.
