While this item was intended to be used by weaker junglers which had clearing issues or which would lose too much health or mana when farming monsters, it was actually used by the stronger, dominant junglers, to have even better jungle clearing. Due to that, this enchantment was overshadowing the other enchantments in high elo and pro play. Icons Devourer Runeglaive Cinderhulk Warrior
