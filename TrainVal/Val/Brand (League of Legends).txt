Subsequent abilities used against a target with Ablaze are empowered. Killing an enemy afflicted with Ablaze or any enemy with an ability restores 30 − 50 (based on level) mana . Ablaze: While afflicted with Ablaze , the target is dealt magic damage equal to 「 2% of their maximum health over 4 seconds. 」 「 0. 167 % of their maximum health every 0. 25 seconds over 4 seconds. 」 Each stack of Ablaze deals damage to the target individually and applies their damage ticks dependent on the time they were applied, even if the duration of all the stacks are refreshed. Ablaze deals 200% damage per tick to monsters , capped at 80. Upon applying 3 stacks of Ablaze to a large monster or enemy champion , the fire becomes unstable, forming an area around the target that grants sight and explodes after 2 seconds, consuming all of their stacks. All enemies within the detonation are dealt magic damage equal to 9% − 13% (based on level) of their maximum health (+ 2% per 100 AP) , reduced by 50% against epic monsters , and applied a stack of Ablaze . The explosion will still occur if the target dies to the ability applying the third stack or during the delay. Brand cannot stack Ablaze more than once on enemies who have exploded in the last 4 seconds. Hide Details Video Info Targeting input Passive Damage type Type Sub-type See Notes Magic Counters Spell shield Blocked Ablaze is a debuff that persists through death . The explosion is not considered a tether effect and will not affect untargetable targets, even if the explosion originated from them. Given the behavior of the stacking mechanic, the damage over time will deal varying amounts of damage based on the time the stacks were applied: At sub-optimal applied times, 2 stacks will deal a minimum of 6% maximum health damage over 4 seconds, but will deal 7% maximum health at optimal applied times. Against small-medium units 3 stacks will deal a minimum of 9% maximum health at sub-optimal times, but 11% maximum health at optimal times. If these stacks are further refreshed at optimal times they can deal up to 12% maximum health over 4 seconds. The burn is persistent damage and the explosion is area damage .

The fireball will bounce to Brand even if he becomes an invalid target while it is currently on a target or is in flight towards him. The fireball acquires a new target as soon as it hits its current target. If the new target becomes invalid, the fireball will fizzle. The fireball may only bounce to valid targets, including Brand . If the initial cast target uses spell shield , Pyroclasm will not bounce. If the bounce is blocked by an enemy's spell shield it will not deal any damage, but it will keep on bouncing. Pyroclasm's damage against enemy champions will not aggro nearby enemy minions. (bug) If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Original View in 3D 880 12.04.2011 Once a tribesman of the icy Freljord named Kegan Rodhe, the creature known as Brand is a lesson in the temptation of greater power. Seeking one of the legendary World Runes, Kegan betrayed his companions and seized it for himself—and, in an instant, the man was no more. His soul burned away, his body a vessel of living flame, Brand now roams Valoran in search of other Runes, swearing revenge for wrongs he could not have suffered in a dozen mortal lifetimes. Unknown voice actor Michal Ivan, Puppetworks Animation Studio Loot eligible Apocalyptic View in 3D 750 12.04.2011 Before the devastation of Runeterra, Kegan Rodhe was a search-and-rescue specialist deployed to active wildfire zones.

Unknown voice actor Unknown artist Road Warrior Loot eligible Vandal View in 3D 520 12.04.2011 The wasteland is full of problems, and there's no better problem solver than Brand.

Sear's animation resembles Annie's basic attack one. Brand's autoattack particle is the same as Morgana's but orange instead of purple. Brand comes from Proto-Germanic *brandaz , meaning "fire, torch, sword". His host's given name Kegan is likely based on Gaelic patronymic Mac Aodhagáin , "son of fire " by coincidence; [2] His surname Rodhe possibly from Old Norse hróðr "praise, renown". [3] Pyroclasm derives from pyroclastic , a term used to describe fast-moving volcanic material, from Greek πῦρ "fire" & κλαστός "broken Brand musical reference comes from the hip-hop group called Brand Nubian See also [ ] League of Legends Wiki | Champions Cancelled Champions Ao Shin Avasha Averdrian CeeCee Cyborg Cowboy Eagle Rider Gavid Husk Iron Engineer Ivan Omen Priscilla Rob Blackblade Seth Tabu Tiki Urf Well References [ ] ↑ Brand's profile page at LeagueOfLegends.com ↑ Matasović, R.
