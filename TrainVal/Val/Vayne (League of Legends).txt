Vayne's dance references gun fu , also known as the Gun Kata . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. Silver Bolts references werewolf fiction , possibly inspired by silver's & other heavy metals' antimicrobial properties . Vayne, Aatrox and Viego are currently the only champions with an ability named the same as their title ( Night Hunter , The Darkin Blade , and Blade of the Ruined King ). As per her retconned lore, Vayne hunts and kills monsters, hybrids, shape-shifters, etc. not due to any ethical guidelines, but to satisfy her bloodlust, making her resemble Dexter Morgan , a fictional serial killer who mostly targets other morally deplorable murderers. Similarly, Vayne & Dexter both developed killing urge after witnessing their respective parents being murdered (Vayne's father & mother; Dexter's mother ). Vayne , Warwick and Trundle are the only champions without damaging area-of-effect abilities. Vayne was nearly cancelled due to her concept artist unable to properly concept her with a big hat.
