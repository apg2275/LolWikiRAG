Total Magic Damage: 20 / 25 / 30% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health Half of the total damage and stealing are applied instantly, and the other half, as well as the size modifiers, are applied every second over the next 4 seconds, even if the target has died .

Hide Details Map-Specific Differences Info Targeting input Unit Target out-of-range override Walk in range of the target Damage type Type Sub-type Minion Aggro DOT damage Magic Drawn Counters Spell shield Blocked The total value of armor and magic resist stolen and damage dealt is determined at the time of cast. The stolen stats do not update dynamically relative to the target's stats at any point during the effect, as the steal is applied to the current value of armor and magic resistance. Trundle gains 11. 7 extra range on his basic attacks (relative to his and enemy center) as a consequence of his increased size . So do his enemies. He gains 3. 78 to 6. 255 range against the target he subjugated , depending on their base size, and so does the target against him. The debuff on the target also persists through death . Trundle will lose the buff if the target loses the debuff, for example if it enters resurrection . (bug) If the target becomes untargetable , dies , or is too far away or no longer in sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable). Map-Specific Differences One for All differences edit Subjugate stacks if cast on the same target more than once by other sources .

Original View in 3D 880 01.12.2010 Trundle is a hulking and devious troll with a particularly vicious streak, and there is nothing he cannot bludgeon into submission—not even the Freljord itself. Fiercely territorial, he chases down anyone foolish enough to enter his domain. Then, his massive club of True Ice at the ready, he chills his enemies to the bone and impales them with jagged, frozen pillars, laughing as they bleed out onto the tundra. Joshua Tomar Joshua 'HUGEnFAST' Brian Smith Loot eligible Lil' Slugger View in 3D 520 01.12.2010 Unable to let go of being rejected from the major and minor leagues, Trundle has joined a little league team after saying he was thirteen years old on an admission form. Trundle is an eleven-foot-tall ice troll who enjoys allying with evil wizards and biting people to death. Practice has been… interesting. Joshua Tomar Sperasoft Studio Day Job Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Junkyard View in 3D 750 01.12.2010 Self-proclaimed king of the Wasteland's endless, irradiated junk heaps, Trundle saunters about his vast 'kingdom' flanked by a small army of sycophantic thugs. Any travelers discovered in his domain are subjected to painfully theatrical displays of grandeur—then beatings, then death. Joshua Tomar Unknown artist Road Warrior Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Traditional View in 3D 975 30.04.2013 Created to capture the original feel of Trundle, one of our first fully reworked champions. Joshua Tomar Mitchell Malloy Traditional Loot eligible Legacy New voiceover New SFX/VFX Constable View in 3D 750 28.11.2014 Constable Trundle's definition of keeping the peace translates to barking insults at jaywalkers, haphazardly placing cones in the street, and perhaps worst of all, plundering doughnuts from all the local bakeries. Needless to say, this behavior results in some very stern browbeatings from Piltover Yard. Joshua Tomar Unknown artist Cops and Robbers Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Worldbreaker View in 3D 750 10.11.2016 The second of four titans prophesied to shatter the world, it has been foretold that Trundle will appear when the moon smothers the sun. In that darkness, he will rise in the north, blanketing all of creation with frost until the land is cold and silent. Joshua Tomar Mike Azevedo Worldbreaker Loot eligible New SFX/VFX Dragonslayer View in 3D 1350 30.01.2020 The king of a clan of giant trolls, Trundle is a revered dragonslayer. Blessed with the ability to command the raw power of mountain ice, he defends his realm from death and destruction. Over the ages, surviving trolls have looked up to him as their fearsome leader in this world torn asunder by dragon fire. Joshua Tomar Lucas Parolin, West Studio Dragon World Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Dragonslayer Trundle Chromas Amethyst Catseye Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Fright Night View in 3D 1350 22.09.2022 Teenage nightmare Trundle leaves everything distressed But he won't lift a finger cleaning up his mess Howling, growling, scowling, his chores he won't address, For he has a team (or two) of Scareball players to impress! Joshua Tomar David Villegas, West Studio Fright Night Loot eligible New SFX/VFX New Animations/Recall Chromas Fright Night Trundle Chromas Catseye Emerald Pearl Rose Quartz Ruby Sapphire Tanzanite Turquoise Patch history [ ] For the expanded patch notes, see here Trivia [ ] The word "trundle" means to "move or cause to move slowly and heavily, typically in a noisy or uneven way." Trundle was the first champion to cost 4800 . Trundle's hair resembles the Troll doll's hair. Trundle's Recall animation is the famous "Winter is Coming" pose from the television series Game of Thrones . The area for Frozen Domain is currently, not counting global abilities, the largest AoE in the game. Trundle, Karma , Lee Sin , and Sejuani are the only champions to feature a 'traditional' skin representing them before their visual updates (his was conceived while producing a 'Frost Troll' skin) Trundle's dance references Dancing Trollface . A side-by-side comparison can be seen here. He will dance faster the more movement speed he has. Trundle , Vayne , and Warwick are the only champions without damaging area-of-effect abilities.
