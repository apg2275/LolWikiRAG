Unit collision (also commonly known as Creepblock )Â refers to the mechanic by which a unit will always attempt to not occupy the same region as another unit in a game of League of Legends . Champions , minions and monsters are all affected by this. Unit collision is governed by and fairly synonymous to the unit's pathfinding radius . For other types of unit radii, see: Unit radius Unit collision is invalidated by ghosting , which is a status effect that disables collision from a unit, giving itself and other units the ability to move through each other without interference; it allows a unit to intersect with another unit's pathing radius . It often comes with a movement speed buff . Champion ability -created terrain consists of units which are immune to ghosting . Baron Nashor is also immune. Most dashes and blinks do not respect unit collision in their path or destination location.
