Similar items Bloodrazor Cinderhulk Nashor's Tooth Runic Echoes Warrior Wit's End Notes Devourer automatically transforms into Sated Devourer when the Devouring passive reaches 30 Devourer stacks . Monsters can only be Devoured once. While stacking Devourer , you are accompanied by a Ghost Dog who will grow with each Devourer stack . At 30 Devourer stacks , the Ghost Dog merges with the wielder and Devourer transforms into Sated Devourer . This enchantment was removed for three reasons: It caused balance issues on otherwise balanced champions like Master Yi , Kayle , and Shyvana (due to their extremely powerful on-hit effects), forcing Riot to nerf them and rebuff most of them once Devourer was removed. The fact that it could trigger on-hit effects twice when stacked allowed champions like Fizz and the aforementioned Master Yi to build tanky after completing this item and an additional on-hit item, since they only needed the on-hit effects to do damage, and could afford to build tanky thereafter; building tanky was not their intended playstyle and negated an intended weakness of them being squishy, causing further balance issues. Devourer was encouraging junglers into a playstyle of AFK farming, which was considered toxic since it forced your team to be at the mercy of the enemy jungler (assuming they weren't also a Devourer jungler) in addition to rewarding junglers for not interacting with the rest of the players. Devourer was replaced by Bloodrazor , and the Phantom Hit effect was moved to a new incarnation of Guinsoo's Rageblade . The latter doesn't need to be stacked with jungle monsters/champion kills, and can be purchased by champions which do not have Smite. However, it is significantly more expensive, and needs to be stacked in combat first. On Devourer 's release in Patch 4.20 , it used the icon for Madred's Razors to represent its current stack count. Bugs There is a known bug with Devourer where getting an assist on Dragon will only reward +1 Devourer stack instead of +5. Try to Smite Dragon in order to get the kill on Dragon for the full +5 stacks . Icons Skirmisher's Sabre Stalker's Blade Tracker's Knife Poacher's Knife Ranger's Trailblazer Old icons 1st version
