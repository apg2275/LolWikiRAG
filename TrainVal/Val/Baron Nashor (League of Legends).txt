Contents 1 Features 1.1 Spawn 1.2 Passives 1.3 Basic Attacks 1.4 Abilities 1.5 Baron pit 2 Strategy 3 Trivia 4 Sound Effects 5 Patch History 6 References Features [ ] Spawn [ ] 20 seconds before spawning, Baron Nashor appears from the furthest point of the camp and wriggles under the bot-side river and toward his pit in the top-side river. Corrupted Rift: When Baron Nashor arrives on the map for the first time, parts of terrain on the map become purple and fissured, matching the corrupted likeness of The Void . In addition, newly-spawned or live non- Draconic Blue Sentinel , Red Brambleback , and Rift Scuttler monsters become permanently corrupted. Corrupted monsters gain increased durability and greatly improved effects when slain. The Blue Sentinel and Red Brambleback also lose their Draconic effects with the Corrupted monsters' respawn. Voidborn: Baron Nashor will spawn in one of three different forms for the remainer of the game, determined randomly: Hunting , Territorial , and All-Seeing . The Territorial and All-Seeing forms cause the terrain around the baron pit to permanently shift (see article or Baron pit section ); the former adds a small wall in front of the pit, while the latter creates a long tunnel laterally. Each form also has a special ability that occurs 6 attacks after using Acid Pool . Passives [ ] All debuffs sourced from Baron Nashor will be removed when his corpse despawns, 4. 5 seconds after he is slain. Presence of the Baron: Baron Nashor is immune to ghosted units (they cannot pass through him). While Baron Nashor is alive, all obstructing champions , pets and wards that are in his unit radius are pushed in front of him. Upon spawning in his pit, Baron Nashor knocks back all units that are in his unit radius . Delayed Evolution: Baron Nashor waits 30 seconds after it leaves combat (dealing or taking damage) before it can level up and gain stats. Debuff Immunity: Baron Nashor is immune to all terrain displacements and immune to all crowd control except stasis . Additionally, Baron Nashor's stats cannot be modified by any external means. Baron's Gaze : Baron Nashor takes 50% reduced damage for 8 seconds from the unit that it has most recently hit with a basic attack , being effective only against one unit at a time. Aura of Destruction: Baron Nashor is surrounded by an aura of destruction, spreading Void Corruption to any units hit by his attacks and abilities. Void Corruption is a stacking debuff that stacks up to 100 times and lasts for 8 seconds. Each stack reduces targets' armor and magic resistance by 0. 5 , for a maximum total of 50 resistances reduction. All attack and ability effects from Baron Nashor refresh the duration of the debuff, but only some will apply stacks of it . Basic Attacks [ ] Baron Nashor has three versions of basic attack , each having a different effect. His basic attacks acquire the nearest unit (including summons ). Corrosion: Each time Baron Nashor launches a basic attack, he will additionally fire a burst to the nearest unit with the lowest number of Void Corruption stacks. The burst deals 70 (+ 20% AD) bonus magic damage and applies one stack of Void Corruption . Single-target Rear Attack: If the target is behind Baron Nashor , he erects a spike dealing 100% AD physical damage . Single-target Ranged Attack: If the target is in front of Baron Nashor , he spits an acid missile at them dealing 100% AD physical damage and applies two additional stacks of Void Corruption . Area Melee Attack: If a target is in front of Baron Nashor within 250 units, he occasionally uses a melee attack instead of a ranged attack, dealing 100% AD physical damage to the primary target and 50% AD physical damage to nearby units. Abilities [ ] Baron Nashor will activate an ability every 6th basic attack . Baron's first ability will be random. However, all abilities after the first are determined, because the ability rotation is cyclical: (e.g.) Acid Pool > Form Ability > Acid Shot > Tentacle Knockup > Acid Pool. If there are more units behind Baron Nashor than in front of him, he will continue to activate the area-of-effect rear attack instead. Acid Pool: After winding up for 2 seconds, Baron Nashor spits out 3 pools of acid in a cone in front of him that land over 0. 75 seconds, dealing 10% AD magic damage to all champions upon impact as well as creating a field for 2. 5 seconds that slows units within by 50%. Form Ability: Baron Nashor gains an ability based on his form: Hunting Baron : Creates a pillar of lightning over all champions that strikes their location after 0. 7 seconds for the first target and every 0. 1 seconds thereafter for each next target. Each strike deals 15% of target's current health magic damage to champions hit, reduced by 50% for each subsequent hit in succession. Territorial Baron : Leans forward with his limbs over 0. 5 seconds, targeting the closest champion, then after 1 second pulls all units in a cone toward him over 0. 33 seconds for 300 units, dealing 75 magic damage to all champions pulled. All-Seeing Baron : Channels his eye to conjure a void rift toward the direction of the two furthest visible champions within 2200 units. Each rift lasts for 3 seconds and deals 「 1000 magic damage over the duration. 」 「 150 magic damage for the first tick and 50 magic damage every 0. 166 seconds thereafter, over a total of 18 ticks. 」 Acid Shot: After winding up for 2 seconds, Baron Nashor spits acid down along a straight line over 2 seconds, dealing 20% AD magic damage to all units within. Tentacle Knockup: Baron Nashor summons a tremor beneath the target's location that erupts with a tentacle after 1. 25 seconds, dealing 25% AD magic damage to units within and knocking them up for 1. 25 seconds. Units near the edge of the eruption are instead slightly knocked away . Area-of-effect rear Attack: Baron Nashor erects a cluster of spikes behind him, dealing 50% AD physical damage to units within the area and stunning them for 0. 5 seconds. Baron pit [ ] All-Seeing pit Hunting pit Territorial pit Strategy [ ] Baron Nashor is a highly coveted objective that is difficult to fight without proper strength and personnel. A tank to endure the damage is almost always required, otherwise there are few champions that can battle the monster self-sufficiently, mainly utilizing immense sustainability and DPS . Securing Baron Nashor is a high-risk investment due to not only his damage and potential crowd control , but also the Void Corruption debuff and the confined pit providing a significant advantage to any intervening counterattack. Sight control of the pit is essential for securing the kill and denying an opportune moment for enemies to intervene and potentially steal the objective. Considering these risks, fighting Baron Nashor is preferably conducted while the enemy team is indisposed, such as when they are much weaker in raw power or when they are at a teammate number disadvantage. Trivia [ ] Brandon 'Ryze' Beck stated a Visual Update was coming for Baron Nashor , later revealed in A Twist of Fate and finally implemented after Summoner's Rift was fully visually updated in Season Five . Old Baron Nashor's skull was placed within his modern counterpart's pit in patch V5.7 . During Snowdown Showdown 2012 , players could earn a summoner icon featuring old Baron Nashor's main head with a santa hat on . Nashor is an anagram for Roshan, being a tribute to the monster filling a similar role in Defense of the Ancients . A box labeled 'Baron Acid' can be seen in the preview video for the launch of the League of Legends' Mac Version. In the Death Recap screen, the blast attack that spreads one stack of Void Corruption was labeled as 'WormAttack' The old Wrath of the Ancients spell was 'wrathdamage'. Voracious Corrosion was originally the name of Baron Nashor's passive spell which applied the Void Corruption debuff and reduced damage dealt to him. As of Season Five's Baron update, the reduced damage buff is separate ( Baron's Gaze ). As of V14.1 , the corruption aura and the debuff have the same name, Void Corruption . Baron Nashor's own Void Corruption (Aura of Destruction) passive buff still mentions the debuff stacks as "Corrosion". This is the only instance in the game where "Corrosion" is mentioned. Voracious Corrosion's old icon was recycled from Tabu's Soul Drain . The old icon for Hand of Baron was recycled from Averdrian's Astral Beam . If Baron and Elder Dragon had a duel, Baron Nashor would lose [1] . Elder Dragon's HP regen is so high that Baron can't even deal damage to him.
